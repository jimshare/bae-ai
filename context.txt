Applicants and the interview
The CalFresh interview serves two main purposes. One purpose is to acquaint the applicant with the program, to answer questions that applicant may have, and to inform applicants of their rights and responsibilities. The other purpose is to gather additional information to determine the household’s eligibility for benefits. Interviews are conducted at application and recertification.
Counties are required to schedule the interview “as promptly as possible to ensure eligible households receive an opportunity to participate within 30 days after the application is filed.” [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(e)(3); MPP § 63-300.46.] Counties may opt into an “on-demand” phone interview process. However, once a county has opted in, all interviews in that county must be done “on-demand” unless the applicant requests an in-person interview or it is apparent the household is eligible for expedited (emergency) services. Counties also have existing non-waiver authority to allow households to do a telephone interview without a scheduled appointment by calling into the county. [See ACL 14-20.]
The interview can be done with the head of the household, their spouse, any responsible member of the household, or an authorized representative. Applicants are allowed to bring anyone they want to the interview. [ACL 21-24.]
Counties must implement one of these interview scheduling methods for CalWORKs no later than July 1, 2021: time block interviews, telephonic contact in conjunction with written communication about scheduling an interview, and same day interviews.  For time block interviews, the designated time block must give households a reasonable window of time to expect a call.  [Id.]  For initial applications, the interview must be scheduled as promptly as possible to ensure that eligible households have an opportunity to participate.  For recertification, the interview must be scheduled so that the household has at least 10 days after the interview to provide verification.  [ACL 21-24, and ACL 21-24E.]  Regardless of the scheduling method used, if a household misses its scheduled interview, at initial application or recertification, the county must send a Notice of Missed Interview.  [ACL 21-24.] The implementation deadline for flexible interview scheduling was extended to January 1, 2022.  [ACL 21-150.]
Interviews are routinely done by telephone for both applications and recertifications.  Counties can do face-to-face interviews if necessary.  However, if a face-to-face interview would be a hardship, the interview must be done by telephone or at a home visit.  Counties must inform applicants that they can have a face-to-face interview and must provide a face-to-face interview if that is requested. [ACL 17-80.]
The California state regulations, however, still only reflect the prior rules (which required the county waive the “face-to-face” interview if all household members are 60 or older or disabled [MPP § 63-300.42] and permit waiving the face-to-face if coming in person poses a hardship for the household. [See MPP § 63-300.43.]
The interview is considered an “official and confidential” discussion. An applicant’s right to privacy must be maintained. The place where the interview occurs must be adequate to preserve the privacy and confidentiality of the interview. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(e)(1).] The scope of the interview cannot extend beyond the examination of eligibility for assistance. [MPP § 63.300.4.] Applicants always have a right to ask questions during the interview.
The applicant household also has an enforceable right to interpreter services for the interview. See the section about people who do not speak English for detailed information about the right to interpreter services.
County case workers and the interview
County case workers have a responsibility to make the applicant feel at ease in the interview. [MPP § 63-300.4.] This includes informing the household of the following:
* The household’s right to a timely determination of benefits;
* Its responsibility to report changes; and
* The right of household members to non-discrimination.
The case worker should help applicants through the rest of the application process. If the applicant has not filled out all of the CalFresh application, California requires the case worker to help the household complete the application. The case worker should review the information in the application and “explore and resolve with the household any unclear or incomplete information.”[7 C.F.R. § 273.2(e)(1); MPP § 63-300.4.] The case worker should also gather and review the list of additional items needed to complete the process. [MPP § 63-300.4.]
Even before eligibility is determined, case workers must discuss with applicants their program responsibilities and requirements including the reporting requirements. This helps ensure that the applicant knows what is expected of her, if determined eligible. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(e)(1); MPP § 63-300.4.]
The interview and verification
During the interview the worker will ask for proof about some things on the application. The Food and Nutrition Act requires the CalFresh office, at the time of application, to give the household a list of things it must do to determine eligibility . [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(c)(5); MPP § 63-300.37.]
The list should be things applicants must prove with documentation. For example: Citizenship could be proved by a birth certificate, baptismal record, and so on. The county cannot request a specific type of verification, nor can it require an applicant to successfully get the proof. The county request must state that the county can help obtain verification, and may be able to pay fees related to getting the requested documentation. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(5)(i); MPP § 63-300.5(i). Simply put, the CalFresh office cannot require applicants to succeed in getting all the information, so long as the applicant can show proof of trying all reasonable efforts to get it.
Households must be given at least 10 days from the date of the request to provide required verification. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f); MPP § 63-300.5(a)(1).]
For more information about the verification process, see the section about verifications the CalFresh office requires
Home visits and the verification process
Applicants and recipients must cooperate in establishing eligibility in order to receive benefits. This may include a home visit when documentary evidence is insufficient to provide “a firm determination of eligibility or benefit level.” [MPP §63-300.5(h)(3), (i); 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(4)(iii).] Home visits must only occur on a case-by-case basis, and must be scheduled in advance with the household. [MPP § 63-300.45]. The county must work out a time with the applicant for the visit before a worker comes, however it does not have to tell applicants the exact time of day of the visit. Applicants do not have to let workers visit their home, but this could lead to a denial of benefits.
Households, however, are not required to meet with one of its fraud investigators. See FNS Memorandum to Program Directors, Food Stamp Program Cooperation with Fraud Investigations (April 24, 2003). For related information, see the section of this Guide about fraud claims.
Missed interviews
If applicants miss their first interview, the CalFresh office must try to help set up another interview. The county must notify each household that misses its interview appointment that it missed the scheduled interview. The household is responsible for rescheduling a missed interview. If the initial interview is missed, it is imperative for the applicant to contact the county. If contacted within the 30-day application window, the county must schedule a second interview within this 30-day period. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2(e)(3), 273.2(h)(1)(i)(D); MPP § 63-300.46.]
The county cannot deny benefits within 30 days of submitting an application due to a missed first interview. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(e)(3).] If applicants miss a second interview, the CalFresh office can deny the application. However, an applicant can call the CalFresh office to request an additional interview, but only if the office has not yet issued a denial. Once the CalFresh office has issued a denial, the applicant is permitted to start the application process again.
If there has not been a request for a second interview, the household can request the interview within 30 days period.  (7 C.F.R. § 273.2(h)(2).)  If the household takes the required action within 60 days, the county should reopen the application without requiring a new application.  (7 C.F.R. § 273.2(h)(2)(A).)


After the household files its application
Once a county receives a minimally completed application — i.e., name, address and signature — the “clock” begins to run, and continues to run even while the applicant works with the county on satisfying the interview and verification requirements.
Counties are held to one of two application processing time standards:
The “normal” 30-day processing standard
Once the CalFresh office that serves the applicant’s county gets the application, it should determine eligibility “as soon as possible,” but cannot take more than 30 days to issue CalFresh benefits, if eligible. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(g)(1); MPP § 63-301.1.] For a review of the various timely application processing rules for CalFresh, see ACIN I-14-11.
The Manual of Policies and Procedures includes a detailed chart breaking out the normal application processing time standards, how they apply in varied situations, the corresponding actions the county must take within each time frame, and how each affects the household’s eligibility for CalFresh benefits. See MPP § 63-301.34.
This 30-day standard applies even if the applicant has applied for CalWORKs or General Assistance (GA) at the same time. This is true despite other programs needing more than 30 days to determine eligibility. (For related information, see the section explaining how CalWORKs diversion payments should not interfere with CalFresh applications.)
The “emergency” (expedited) 3-day standard
If eligible for emergency (expedited) CalFresh benefits, the county welfare office has three days to give applicants CalFresh benefits. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(i)(3)(i); MPP § 63-301.5.] For a review of the expedited services timely processing rules, see ACIN I-14-11.
The earlier an applicant signs an application form and turns it in to the CalFresh office, the more CalFresh benefits he will get. If benefits are granted, the applicant is owed benefits starting from the day the signed application was submitted. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(a)(2); MPP § 63-503.13.]
Examples: The Browns and Griffins are two different households eligible for CalFresh benefits. The Browns apply for benefits on June 15 using the normal processing standard. On July 15 the Browns are granted benefits. The Browns should then receive benefits for the whole month of July, and for 15 days of June. Meanwhile, The Griffins are eligible for expedited CalFresh benefits but apply on June 28th. On July 1, the Griffins are granted benefits. The Griffins should then receive benefits for the whole month of July and for three days of June.

How and where to get a CalFresh application
The CalFresh process begins with an application . You can apply in person, online or by sending an application in the mail. If you need expedited (emergency) CalFresh benefits, applying in person at the local office is best. There are a number of ways to get an application in California including:
* Call the state-wide CalFresh hotline: The toll free phone number is (877) 847-3663. The hotline currently accepts calls in English and Spanish. If applicants enter their zip code, they can hear specific county application information. An operator is available during business hours for application requests.
* Contact the county directly: Applicants can find the contact information for their county in the phone book or online. They can request an application by phone, fax, mail or in person.
* Download an application from the Web: A person can also download a CalFresh application in a number of languages.
* Apply online: People can apply on-line, through the automation system serving their county. (See the tips for applying online, below.)
* Pick up an application at a community location: Legal aid offices, community action agencies, food banks and welfare rights groups often have CalFresh applications. Many food banks and community organizations now have “food assisters” who can help with on-line applications.
* Apply for reduced-cost school meals: Counties and schools can treat an application for reduced-cost meals as a CalFresh application if they have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Local Education Agency. [ACIN I-38-13.] (Since no additional funding was provided, this program is voluntary at this point. Check with your county to see if it is participating.)
* Get linked through Social Security benefits: Individuals on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) may have a streamlined application process. This is because the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) works with the Social Security Administration (SSA) to have a means of identifying individuals eligible for benefits. Counties can tap into that information and facilitate the application processing of these individuals. However, counties are not required to have nor use this technology. [See AB 69 (2011).]
Applying online can be easy and save you a lot of time and hassle. People can apply for CalFresh using BenefitsCal.  People can also do their annual recertifications and semi-annual reports on BenefitsCal.  People can also apply for any county using  GetCalFresh.org. (It’s mobile friendly!).  The GetCalFresh online application tool for CalFresh will sunset on September 30, 2025.  (ACWDL, May 14, 2024.)  The sunset will happen in phases.  The GetCalFresh tool for joint applications processing of CalFresh and Social Security applications with counties the Social Security Administration will sunset and transition to BenefitsCal on September 30, 2024.  The Semi-Annual reporting (SAR 7) feature in GetCalFresh will sunset in December 2024.  The GetCalFresh application assistance tool, including the community based organizations portal, and the document uploader tool in GetCalFresh will sunset in June 2025.  The GetCalFresh website and customer service will sunset on September 30, 2025.  [Id.]
People can apply for CalFresh at the same time they apply for or renew their Medi-Cal benefits. This is part of an ongoing process to increase the number of CalFresh beneficiaries. Counties must screen Medi-Cal applicants and beneficiaries for CalFresh interest and eligibility. [ACL 21-52.]
Filling out the application
Counties cannot require applicants to complete any form. [MPP § 63-300.21.] A CalFresh application does not need to be completely filled out to be submitted. As long as the application has the name and address of the applicant, and is signed. Counties may not require the interview to complete an application. [See MPP § 63-300.32; 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(b)(1)(v).]  The applicant or recipient is entitled to a receipt when submitting the application or any other documents.  [MPP § 63-300.6.]  Counties are not required to provide a paper copy of an electronic CalFresh application submitted in person at a local office unless the client requests one.  [ACL 20-98.]  However, Counties must give clients who submit an electronic application in person at a local office the opportunity to review the information recorded electronically and counties must inform clients who submit an electronic application in person at a local office that they will be given a paper copy upon request.  [Id.]
The complete CalFresh application form is called the CF 285.  That form is now available on request in digitally accessible format for use by a screen reader, large print format and braille.  [ACL 19-49.]
Since benefits must be issued within 30 days of receipt of an application, it is best to get the application in quickly. The applicant should not wait for help in completing an application. The applicant should send the application in with the name and address information completed and with a signature. The county must then assist the household in completing the rest of the application.
Some counties also work with community-based organizations to assist applicants in filling out the paperwork. If such help is desired, ask your county for community contacts.
Welfare and Institutions Code section 18900.4 now requires counties to give CalFresh households the option to complete an application and recertification by telephone and capture their signature by an electronic method, such as a telephone signature.  The electronic signature method must require the client to take an affirmative action to indicate concurrence, such as a PIN number or giving verbal affirmation; the record of the signature must be maintained electronically and linked to the documents; and the process must constitute a legal signature.  [ACL 22-20.]
In addition, federal law requires the county to make an audio recording of the household’s verbal assent and a summary of the information to which the household assents; the audio file must be linked to the application; and the county must provide the household with a printed copy of the application with instructions for how to correct any errors or omissions.  [ACL 17-57; ACL 22-20.]
County welfare department office access
County welfare departments must implement procedures that ensure members of the public, including those with disabilities, are notified of and have access to county welfare department programs.  [ACIN I-83-21.]  Counties must conduct an annual review of the hours of operation of public offices to ensure that the needs of recipients, including those who work, are adequately met.  [Id.]  Regular business hours are defined as a minimum of 8 hours per day, except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.  [Id.]  Counties maintain an office that is open to the public that offers basic certification services during regular business hours, including accepting applications, interviewing applicants, and accepting notice of change in household circumstances.  [Id.]  Counties can implement risk reduction measures because of COVID-19 in accordance with local county health orders, such as limiting capacity in lobbies and social distancing.  [Id.]
Absent an order from federal, state or local officials to close counties to the public, counties must continue to offer in-person assistance to applicants and recipients in addition to telephone and internet assistance.  [ACIN I-76-20.]  If a county closes during regular business hours, the county must: 1) provide the opportunity to file an application for and receive benefits within mandated timeframes by making applications available and providing a drop-box, mail slot or other reasonable means for filing applications; 2) provide the opportunity to file an application for and receive expedited CalFresh, by maintaining sufficient staff to accept and act on all such applications, and/or maintain a local telephone service with sufficient staff to accept and act upon all applications as if the requests has been made in person at the county office; 3) have a telephone announcement with working days and times, when the offices will be closed, and procedures for applying for benefits, and 4) post notices at welfare department offices of times when the office will be closed, procedures to obtain and file applications, and procedures for applying for and receiving expedited CalFresh and the right to a receipt for hand-delivered documents. [Id.; ACIN I-83-21.]  Applications are assumed to be filed on the date the office is closed.  [ACIN I-83-21.]  The county must have a method to give a receipt on request.  [Id.]
Counties must provide access to benefits and services by telephone in a timely manner. Extended wait times, which require applicants and recipients to hold for hours or call back on multiple days are not compliant. [Id.]
Best practices for counties include triaging client needs to limit lobby traffic and the number of people in the lobby, setting up stations outside of the county office to accept applications and screen for eligibility, providing accessible phones for clients when the county provides applications in boxes outside of a partially closed office, setting up drive through drop-off stations for no contact delivery of documents, issuing homeless assistance benefits to the client’s EBT card, and offering pick-up mail services for homeless clients. [Id.]
Prerelease application process for incarcerated persons
Currently, California does not have a statewide process for processing pre-release CalFresh applications.  [ACWDL, November 18, 2022.]  California has requested a federal waiver to create such a process.  [Id.]  However, California has a waiver for a pilot project in Orange County from March 1, 2021 to February 28, 2023 that allows incarcerated persons to apply for CalFresh up to 30 days before their release date.  [Id.]
Counties can partner with community based organizations to provide application assistance inside county jails.  [Id.]
Disqualification for certain convicted felons who are not in compliance with their sentence
Any adult who has been convicted of aggravated sexual abuse, murder, sexual exploitation and other abuse of children, a Federal or State offense involving sexual assault, or an offense under State law determined by the Attorney General to be substantially similar to one of the first three offenses listed, after February 7, 2014, and who is not in compliance with the terms of their sentence, will not be eligible for CalFresh benefits. [7 U.S.C. 2015(r); 7 C.F.R. 273.11(s); ACL 23-59; ACL 23-59E.]  This rule was added by the 2014 federal Farm Bill.
7 C.F.R. 273.11(s) require an attestation by all individuals applying or recertifying for CalFresh benefits whether they have been convicted of one of these crimes as an adult, and whether the convicted household member is complying with the terms of their sentence. Individuals may provide attestations in writing, verbally, or both.  CalFresh applications will have a new question where individuals can state whether the individual or any adult member of their household has been convicted of any of the disqualifying crimes, and if so whether they are in compliance with the terms of their sentence. [ACL 23-59; ACL 23-59E.] The online applications will also have the new attestation requirement added. [Id.]
Counties must explain the attestation requirement to the applicant household during the interview. [Id.] Individuals cannot be required to come to the county office only to make the attestation. [Id.] The individual’s attestation must be documented by the county in the case file. [Id.]
Verification can only be requested if the attestations is considered questionable, which is when the application has contradicting information, or discrepancies that would cast doubt on the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy. [Id.] For questionable applications, the county must verify any conviction for crimes and that the individual is out of compliance with the terms of their sentence. When verifying an attestation, counties can use their Special Investigation Unit, Investigators, and R-IEVS Fleeing Felon Match. [Id.]
Application processing must not be delayed beyond required processing times only because verification has not yet been received. [Id.] If the county must act on the case to meet the time standards, the application must be processed without consideration of the individual’s conviction status. [Id.]
The implementation of the new eligibility disqualifications will be effective upon funding and completion of automation in CalSAWS. [Id.]


Special Rules for Residents of Institutions
There are special rules for eligibility for CalFresh for residents of institutions.  A resident of an institution is an individual who provided over 50 percent of three meals daily at the institution as part of the institution’s normal services.  In general, residents of institutions are ineligible for CalFresh.  However, several groups can be eligible for CalFresh because they are not considered residents of institutions.  These groups are residents of federally subsidized housing for the elderly, residents of a drug and alcohol (DAA) rehabilitation center for regular participation in a drug or alcohol treatment program, residents of a group living arrangement who are disabled or blind, temporary residents of a shelter for battered persons and residents of public or private-nonprofit shelters for homeless persons.  [ACL 19-51.]
A DSS treatment center is a residential drug addiction or alcohol treatment and rehabilitation center.  [Id.; 7 C.F.R. § 273.11(e)(1).]  For CalFresh purposes, a DAA treatment center must be operating under Title 19 Part B of the Public Health Services Act or be authorized by the Food and Nutrition Service as a retailer for its residents to be eligible for CalFresh.  [Id.]  DAA treatment centers cannot require residents to apply for CalFresh.  [Id.]  If a resident voluntarily applies for CalFresh, they must apply through an Authorized Representative who is employed by and designated by the DAA treatment center.  [Id.]  The DAA treatment center can require residents to use an Authorized Representative employed by the DAA treatment center for receiving and using benefits.  [Id.]
When a household leaves the DAA treatment center, the DAA treatment center must 1) notify the county, provide the household with a change report and advise the household to return the change report to the county within 10 days; 2) provide the household with its EBT card and 3) return household benefits.  If benefits have already been spent on the household and the household leaves prior to the 16th of the month, the DAA must return at least one-half of the monthly allotment.  If the household leaves after the 16th of the month, the remaining portion of the benefits must be returned to the household. [Id.; 7 C.F.R. § 273.11(e)(6).]
The DAA treatment center is responsible for any, overissuances, losses or misuse of benefits, misrepresentation of facts or intentional program violations.  The resident is held harmless for these overissuances.  [Id.; 7 C.F.R. § 273.11(e)(7); MPP § 63-503.477.]
Sober living environments cannot be considered a DAA treatment center for CalFresh purposes because no state agency licenses them.  [Id.]  Sober living environments can be authorized by the Food and Nutrition Service as a retailer.  [Id.]
A group living arrangement is a public or private-nonprofit residential home for disabled or blind persons that served no more than 16 residents.  A group living arrangement must be certified by CDSS.  [Id.; 7 C.F.R. § 271.2.]  Residents of group living arrangements must be blind or disabled to be eligible for CalFresh.  [Id.]  Residents of private for-profit group living arrangements are ineligible for CalFresh. [Id.]
If an employee designated by the group living arrangement is acting as an Authorized Representative for the purpose of receiving and using benefits, the group living arrangement may purchase and prepare food to be consumed by CalFresh recipients on a group basis if residents normally obtain their meals at a central location or meals are prepared at a central location for delivery to residents.  [Id.]
If a household leaves the group living arrangement and no benefits have been spent on the behalf of the household for that month, the group living arrangement must return the full monthly allotment.  If the household leaves prior to the 16th of the month and benefits, the group living arrangement must return one-half of the benefit allotment.  If only one member of the household leaves, the group living arrangement must return a pro rata share to the individual who is leaving.  If the household leaves after the 16th of the month and benefits have already been spent on behalf of the household, the household does not receive any benefits for the remainder of the month. [Id.]
When the group living arrangement is the authorized representative, it is responsible for any, overissuances, losses or misuse of benefits, misrepresentation of facts or intentional program violations and the resident is held harmless.  [Id.]
Persons who reside in shelters for battered persons that are public or private-nonprofits or are authorized by the Food and Nutrition Service, and which are residential facilities that serve meals are eligible for CalFresh.  The Food and Nutrition Service can provide point of sale devices to shelters for battered persons.  [Id.]
A shelter for homeless persons is a public or private-nonprofit facility that temporarily houses homeless persons.  Shelter for the homeless may be a homeless meal provider to accept CalFresh benefits.  Homeless meal providers must be authorized by the Food and Nutrition Service and meals must include food purchased by the homeless meal provider. [Id.]
Individuals must be homeless to be eligible to use CalFresh at a homeless meal provider.  An employee of a homeless meal provider cannot be an authorized representative.  The homeless meal provide cannot require persons to use CalFresh benefits for their food.  The Food and Nutrition Service can provide point of sale devices to homeless shelters that are meal service providers. [Id.]


Special eligibility rules for the “elderly” or “disabled”
The CalFresh program gives special help to people who are “elderly” or “disabled” regarding:
* How much income they can have and still get CalFresh benefits (see the section about income limits);
* What are expenses and how much of their expenses they can deduct from their income (see the section about income deductions for the rules applicable to a household with an “elderly and disabled” member);
* How much in resources they can have and still get CalFresh benefits (for more details, see the section about how many resources a household can have);
* Whether they have to register for work (see the section about exemptions from work requirements for more information);
* Whether they may be a separate household, even if they eat with others whose income is too high to get CalFresh benefits (see the section about options for multiple and separate CalFresh households in the same house); and
* The length of their certification period (for more details, see the section about CalFresh time limits).
* Can use their CalFresh benefits at certain restaurants and grocery stores to buy prepared meals through the Restaurant Meals Program.  Effective September 1, 2021, the Restaurant Meals Program is statewide.  [ACL 21-100.]  EBT cards must allow all CalFresh recipients who are eligible for the Restaurant Meals Program to utilize benefits in all Restaurant Meals Program authorized restaurants statewide. [ACL 18-24.]
For related information, see the section about how “elderly” and “disabled” are defined by the SNAP program.




How “elderly” and “disabled” are defined
In the Food and Nutrition Act, “elderly” and “disabled” are terms of art that affect CalFresh eligibility and benefits. [See, generally, 7 U.S.C. § 2012(j); 7 C.F.R. § 271.2 (definition of elderly or disabled member); MPP § 63-102(e)(1).]
The Food and Nutrition Act defines “elderly” as someone 60 years of age or older. [Id.]
To be considered “disabled” for CalFresh purposes, the person must receive disability benefits. The local CalFresh office cannot decide for itself that a person is disabled. Rather, people who receive any of the following disability benefits count as “disabled” in the CalFresh Program:
* Supplemental Security Income (SSI);
* Social Security disability or blindness benefits;
* Disability-related Medi-Cal or Medicaid;
* Disability-related General Assistance (GA) when the eligibility to receive those benefits is based upon disability or blindness criteria which are at least as
stringent as those used for eligibility for SSI;
* Interim assistance pending receipt of SSI;
* Public disability retirement pensions, if it is for a kind of disability that Social Security says cannot get better;
* Railroad Retirement disability annuity payments;
* Veterans’ disability compensation;
[7 U.S.C. §§ 2012(j)(2-7); 7 C.F.R. § 271.2 (definition of “elderly or disabled member”); MPP §§ 63-102(e)(1)(B-K).]
In this context — about the definition of “disabled” for purposes of the CalFresh program — the status of receiving SSI benefits does not confer eligibility for SNAP benefits, but rather is used to otherwise determine categorical eligibility for the “disabled.” This is important because the criterion for a disability under any of the assistance programs listed above must be as stringent as the disability standard under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. [See 7 C.F.R. § 271.2 (definition of “elderly or disabled member”); 7 U.S.C. § 2012(j)(2)(B).]
The disability definition changes for veteran’s benefits depending on whether the recipient is the veteran, a spouse or child of a veteran. The following may qualify as “disabled”:
   * Veterans: Eligibile if the verteran has a service or non-service connected disability that the Veterans Administration (“VA”) has rated or paid as “total.” Also, veterans with a service or non-service connected disability whom the VA deems in need of regular aid-and-attendance or permanently housebound.
   * Spouse: If the VA says the surviving spouse is someone needing regular aid-and-attendance, or is permanently house-bound, or is receiving or approved for service-connected death benefits or pension benefits for a non-service-connected death, AND the spouse has a permanent disability under the Social Security standards.
   * Child: A surviving child whom the VA says can never support himself or who is receiving or approved for service-connected death benefits or pension benefits for a non-service-connected death, and the child has a permanent disability under the Social Security standards.
[See MPP §§ 63-102(e)(1)(G) through (J).]
Someone who has been approved for disability benefits, but is not getting payments because an “overpayment” is being recouped, should be treated as “disabled.” Individuals whose SSI or TANF (in California, known as CalWORKs) benefits are negatively affected this way are still considered “recipients,” and therefore still categorically eligible. Examples of “negative benefits” would include suspended benefits, reduced benefits for recoupment, and unpaid benefits because the grant is less than the minimum benefit. Someone who has been approved for disability benefits but has not started to receive them should also be treated as disabled. For related information, see the section about the Special eligibility rules for the “elderly” or “disabled.”








Special rules for students
   * Definition of “student”
   * Exceptions
   * Additional
The rules prohibiting “students” from getting CalFresh benefits are complex. There are myriad definitions and exceptions affecting student eligibility for CalFresh. But to boil it down to its essence, the bar against a student getting CalFresh requires a two-step determination: First, does the person fit the definition of “student”? If so, then second, does the student NOT fall within one of the listed exceptions? Carefully evaluate these two questions to ensure the prohibition against a student getting CalFresh benefits is correctly determined. Remember, the “student bar” applies, if at all, only to the individual, and not the household.  More details are available in the CDSS CalFresh Student Handbook version 2.0.
Definition of “student”
Here’s the drill:
   * The student — aged 18-49 — must be physically and mentally fit. If the individual has a disability, they should not be barred from receiving CalFresh.
   * The student must be enrolled at least “half time.” This component is defined by the school. [7 C.F.R. § 273.5(a); MPP §§ 63-406.1 and 63-406.21.]
   * The student must be enrolled in “higher education.” [7 C.F.R. § 273.5(a); MPP §§ 63-406.1 and 63-406.21.] Higher education institutions are either:
   * business, trade, technical or vocational schools normally requiring a high school diploma or GED to enroll; or
   * a junior, community, two-year or four-year college or university, or graduate school, regardless whether a high school diploma or GED is required.
   * Students must be both enrolled at least “half-time” (as defined by the school) and enrolled in a “regular curriculum.” [MPP § 63-406.111(a)(2).]
   * “Regular curriculum” means the course in which the person is enrolled meets the standard requirements for graduation or certification or qualification in a particular field of study. [MPP § 63-406.111.]
   * If the program or course — as opposed to the college — does not require a diploma or GED, the student bar would not apply. [MPP § 63-406.111(a)(2)(A); 60 Fed.Reg. 48865-69.] (For example, if an English as a second language (ESL) program generally does not require a high school degree or GED, then all students enrolled in ESL would not be considered “enrolled in higher education,” for purposes of the student prohibition of receiving CalFresh.)
Exceptions
See, generally, 7 C.F.R. §§ 273.5(b); MPP § 63-406.211. Individuals can get CalFresh benefits if they meet one of the following requirements:
   * Employed 20 hours a week based on a reasonably anticipated monthly average [ACL 12-37; ACL 17-97; ACIN I-66-16].
   * Receiving federal or state work-study money. “Receiving” means when the student is approved for state or federally work study for the current school term, anticipates working during the term, and has not refused a work assignment.  [ACL 17-05; ACIN I-89-15.] This exemption applies even if a work study job assignment has not yet begun or is not available.  The exemption begins the month the school term starts or the month work study is approved, whichever is later. The exemption continues until the end of the month the school term ends.  [MPP § 63-406.212].  CDSS has created a form letter that colleges can use to verify work study approval.  [ACL 20-114.]
   * Approved for a TANF-funded Cal Grant A or B. [ACL 17-05.] The California Student Aid Commission should provide written notification to recipients of Cal Grant A or B awards regarding their potential eligibility for CalFresh.  [ACL 18-27.]
   * Students with children, as follows:
   * full-time student with a child under age 12; or
   * part-time student with a child under age six or a child between ages six and 12 for whom adequate care is not available; or
   * receiving CalWORKs;
   * Enrolled in a CalFresh employment and training (FSET) program, or other state or local job training programs that USDA will accept. [7 C.F.R. § 273.5(b)(11).]
   * Does not intend to register for the next normal school term. [7 C.F.R. § 273.5(c).] See ACIN I-36-12 for treatment of applicants declaring intent not to re-enroll.
   * Enrolled in a program to increase the student’s employability, including programs for low-income students that are operated by a state or local government where one or more of the components of the program are equivalent to an Employment and Training (E&T) component.  [7 C.F.R. § 273.5(b)(11).]  Those components include Adult Basic Education, Career & Technical Education, English Language Acquisition, Work Readiness Training, and Work Experience.  CDSS determines whether a state or local program qualifies under this definition.  [ACL 22-46.]  Campus based programs that meet these requirements must submit an application to CDSS on or before September 1, 2022.  Counties will no longer participate in the process of identifying campus based LPIEs. CDSS has a list of approved programs on its website.  After September 1, 2022, the list will be updated monthly to identify new programs, newly qualifying programs and previously approved programs that no longer meet the criteria.  [Id.]
CDSS has determined that Campus Based Employment and Research and Teaching Assistantship Program always meet the criteria for being considered LPIEs and therefore students in those programs are eligible for CalFresh benefits.  [Id.]
Programs at private institutions are no longer eligible for LPIE status because the programs must be operated by a state or local government. [Id.] Previously approved programs at private institutions are removed from the approved list effective September 1, 2022.  Students who are already enrolled in those programs and are receiving CalFresh on that basis must remain eligible for the length of their certification period.  Student eligibility status must be reassessed at the student’s next recertification.  [Id.]
Most state-funded and foster youth programs previously approved as LPIEs will be removed from the approved list.  These programs will need to be individually assessed and approved as meeting the criteria to be LPIEs.  [Id.]
Programs that were previously approved that now must be individually identified and assessed as having a component equivalent to a CalFresh Education and Training component include: Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS), Educational Opportunity Program (EOP),  Disabled Students Programs and Services (DSPS) & Student Academic Services (SAS),Cooperative Agencies Resources for Education (CARE) Program, McNair Scholars Program, Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) Program, Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) Program, Guardian Scholars Program, Foster Youth Success Initiative (FYSI), Cooperating Agencies Foster Youth Educational Support (CAFYES), Chafee Education and Training Voucher (ETV) Program, and Extended Foster Care (AB 12/AB 212).  [Id.] Students who are already enrolled in those programs and are receiving CalFresh on that basis must remain eligible for the length of their certification period.  Student eligibility status must be reassessed at the student’s next recertification.  [Id.]
Students who are enrolled in a LPIE should be informed by their campus that they meet an exception to the student eligibility rule.  If a student states, verbally or in writing, that they are  enrolled in a program that is on the list of approved LPIEs, counties should exempt the student from the student rule unless that information is questionable.  [Id.] If the information is questionable, acceptable verification can include, a transcript, an email from an instructor, verbal affirmation from a campus official, or targeted outreach emails from campuses to LPIE      enrollees.  [Id.]  If a program does not appear on the LPIE list, counties must explore whether the student is enrolled in another LPIE or meets another exemption from the student rule before  determining that the student is ineligible for CalFresh.   [Id.]
   * Enrolled in a Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act program. [MPP § 63-406.216; ACL 15-70.]
   * Enrolled in Extended Opportunities Programs and Services. [MPP § 63-406.216; ACL 15-70.]
While there are all these special rules applicable to students, in practice the rules do not matter for “categorically eligible” CalWORKs households, since all CalWORKs household members can be students and still qualify for CalFresh benefits. For more specific information about how “categorically eligibility” affects student eligibility for CalFresh, see the section explaining how CalWORKs, General Assistance and Medi-Cal recipients are almost always categorically eligible.
For information about verification of student rule exemptions, see Verifications the CalFresh Office Requires.
Additional exceptions to student rule because of COVID-19
The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 expands the exception for work study to any student eligible to participate in a state or federally financed work study during the regular school year, as determined by the school. While this exception is in effect, it is no longer required that students be approved for work study and anticipate working. [ACL 21-11.] CDSS has temporarily changed the work study verification letter to reflect this change.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 adds an exception to the CalFresh student rule for students who have a zero dollar expected family contribution. [Id.] This is determined by information on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the California Dream Act Application. The California Student Aid Commission determines who has a zero dollar expected family contribution. Verification can include, but is not limited to, a letter from the California Student Aid Commission confirming a zero dollar expected family contribution, a student’s Student Aid Report or a financial aid offer letter. [Id.] The California Student Aid Commission will send all students with a zero dollar expected family contribution an informing letter about this new exception to the CalFresh student rule.
These new exemptions will no longer be available to new CalFresh applicants beginning on June 10, 2023 (30 days after the end of the federal Public Health Emergency). [ACIN I-18-23.]
Students who are currently exempt under one of the COVID-19 exemptions must remain exempt until their next annual recertification. [Id.] Student status is not redetermined mid-period or periodic report.  [Id.]  Beginning July 1, 2023, students who must do annual recertification will need to meet one of the permanent exemptions to the CalFresh student rule in order to be eligible. [Id.]


Homeless rights in the CalFresh program
The homeless have all the same rights under the CalFresh program that any other people do. Homeless people also have some special rights.
Who is homeless? An individual is homeless if the person:
   * Has no fixed, regular place you sleep at night; or
   * Lives in a shelter, an armory, or a welfare hotel: or
   * Lives in a half-way house; or
   * Is living for less than 90 days in someone else’s home; or
   * Lives somewhere that people do not usually live, such as a doorway, a lobby, a bus station, a hallway, a car, or a subway.
[7 C.F.R. § 271.2; MPP § 63-102(h)(2)(A)-(D) (definition of “homeless individual”).]
Here’s the basic drill:
No Address is necessary: The county welfare office cannot make homeless people give a mailing address if they do not have one. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2, 273.3(a) ; MPP § 63-401.5.] Homeless people can get benefits even if they have no fixed mailing address or live on the street. [7 C.F.R. § 273.3(a); MPP 63-401.5.]
CalFresh benefits for shelter residents: Homeless people can get CalFresh benefits even if they live in a shelter and get free meals there. [7 C.F.R. § 273.1(b)(7)(vi)(E); MPP § 63-402.46.] To get CalFresh benefits, a homeless person does not have to have any place to cook or store food.[7 C.F.R. § 273.3(a); MPP § 63-402.46.]
No Semi-Annual Reports: Homeless individuals do not have to file a semi-annual SAR 7 Eligibility Status Report.” But to get this exception, the entire household must be homeless. [7 U.S.C. § 2015(c)(1)(A)(ii); 7 C.F.R. § 273.21(b)(1)(ii); MPP § 63-505.214.]
Homeless Youth: The California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has issued formal directives about the rights of homeless youth. [ACIN I-39-13 and ACL 13-104.]
How can the homeless verify their identity and residence?
Identity: The CalFresh caseworker is required to verify the identity of an applicant or recipient. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(C)(vii); MPP § 63-300.5(e)(3).] But there are many ways to prove identity. A photo I.D. is only one way. No one should be denied CalFresh benefits simply because the person does not have a photo I.D. [7 C.F.R § 273.2(f)(1)(C)(vii) (“any documents which reasonably establish the applicant’s identity must be accepted, and no requirement for a specific type of document … may be imposed”); see also ACIN I-39-13 (homeless youth are not required to have photo I.D.)] To prove identity, an applicant can use such things as a work or school I.D., an I.D. card for health benefits, an I.D. from another social services program such as CalWORKs (TANF). An applicant can also use wage stubs, a birth certificate, or a voter registration card. [MPP § 63-300.5(e)(3).]
Collateral contacts: The CalFresh caseworker can also verify a person’s identity by calling someone, such as a shelter worker or an employer, who can confirm their identity. Under the CalFresh rules, a phone call to someone who can confirm a person’s identity is called a “collateral contact.” [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(C)(vii); MPP § 63-300.5(h)(2).]
Residency: Homeless households are not required to verify where they live. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(C)(vi); MPP § 63-401.5.] Residency need not be verified “in unusual cases (such as homeless households, some migrant farm worker households, or households newly arrived in a project area) where verification of residency cannot be reasonably accomplished.” [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)C)(vi).] But if the person lives in a shelter, it may be helpful to bring a letter to the CalFresh office from a shelter employee confirming that fact.
Can a homeless person get a deduction for shelter expenses?
Homeless people can get a “homeless shelter deduction” instead of the regular excess shelter deduction. [MPP § 63-502.351.] The homeless shelter deduction allows people who are homeless, and expect to spend or have spent any amount of money on shelter. [7 C.F.R. § 273.9(d)(6)(i); MPP § 63-502.351.]
No proof is required before or after the fact. [MPP § 63-502.353; ACIN I-15-23.] If the person gets the homeless shelter deduction, no utility cost is allowed (such as a “telephone utility allowance”). [MPP § 63-502.351.]
If the household spends more on shelter than more than the homeless shelter deduction amount, and can show it, then it can deduct the higher amount (i.e., towards the excess shelter deduction). [See MPP § 63-502.353; ACIN I-73-04.]
If a household experiencing homelessness is living in a vehicle, reasonably anticipated or recurring maintenance costs of the vehicle, including vehicle payments, and collision and comprehensive insurance premiums, are allowable shelter costs.  [ACIN I-15-23.]  Costs of overnight parking and camping fees are also valid shelter expenses.  [Id.]  Expenses that occur less than monthly can be averaged over the period for which they are paid.  [Id.]
Costs of fuel to operate a vehicle are not allowable shelter or utility costs.  [Id.]  However, the cost of gasoline for a generator, propane or firewood are allowable utility expenses.  [Id.]  Liability and medical insurance premiums are not allowable shelter costs.  [Id.]  The cost of ice for keeping food fresh is not an allowable deduction because ice is a food item that can be bought with CalFresh benefits.  [Id.]
Households experiencing homelessness that have utility costs but not shelter costs may claim a utility allowance.  [Id.]
A household that is eligible for the Homeless Shelter Deduction is not eligible for the $20.01 State Utility Assistance Subsidy.  If a household would receive a higher benefit allotment with the Standard Utility Deduction than with the Homeless Shelter Deduction, the household is eligible for the State Utility Assistance Subsidy.  [Id.]
The homeless shelter deduction in California for Fiscal Year 2024 is $179.66. [ACIN I-48-23.]  Starting for Fiscal Year 2020, the homeless shelter deduction is indexed to inflation.  [ACL 19-38.]
What other special help can the homeless receive?
Duty to extend special help to the homeless: CalFresh offices must have special procedures that serve homeless people (as well as the elderly and disabled, for that matter). [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(a); MPP § 63-601.11.] The county welfare office must help get the CalFresh benefits to the recipient each month. [7 C.F.R. § 274.2(a); MPP § 63-601.11.] While this is less of a problem with the emergence of the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system for distributing CalFresh and other welfare benefits, California counties still must help recipients get their EBT card. For example, the county welfare office may help the recipient by finding him an authorized representative, or by mailing the EBT card to a shelter, or by allowing the recipient to pick up the EBT card at the office, or by using “any other appropriate means.” [7 C.F.R. § 274.2(a); MPP § 63-601.11.]
Outreach to the homeless: State SNAP agencies can get federal money to do outreach to homeless people to help them get on the CalFresh program. [7 C.F.R. § 272.5(c).] California has adopted a homeless outreach program. [Welf. & Inst. Code § 18904.2 et seq.] The law requires that CDSS develop materials on expedited service (emergency CalFresh benefits) for the homeless and give the materials and the shortened application to homeless shelters for use with their clients. [Welf.& Inst. Code § 18904.25.] The law also requires local county welfare departments to offer annual CalFresh training to homeless shelter staff. [Welf. & Inst. Code § 18904.25(b).]
Homeless youth: Homeless youth who are not living with their parents or under the control of an adult can get CalFresh benefits on their own. The income of their parents must not be used in calculating eligibility. [7 C.F.R. § 273.1(b)(1)(iii); MPP § 63-402.141.]


Farm worker rights in the CalFresh program
Migrant and seasonal farm workers have all of the same rights under the CalFresh (SNAP) program that other people do. They also have some special rights.
Migrant or seasonal farm workers may have other special rights if they are homeless. (See the other sections about special rules applicable to the homeless for more details.) Even migrant or seasonal farm workers who live in temporary housing may qualify as homeless people.
Households do not have to have a fixed address to get CalFresh benefits. [7 C.F.R. § 273.3(a); MPP § 63-401.] They only have to live in the area at the time they apply. Farm workers can apply without help from their crew leader or labor contractor. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(c)(1); MPP § 63-300.3.] If they qualify, they do not have to let their CalFresh benefits be sent to the crew leader or labor contractor. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(n)(4)(iii); MPP §§ 63-402.8, 63-601.1.]
Migrant and seasonal farm workers have a right to get CalFresh benefits for a full month, even if they apply after the beginning of the month, if they got SNAP benefits within the last 30 days. [7 U.S.C. § 2017(c)(2)(C); 7 C.F.R. § 273.10(a)(1)(ii); MPP § 63-301.5.] It does not matter whether they received SNAP benefits in the same state or somewhere else, as long as they were getting SNAP benefits within the last 30 days.
Example: On March 1, the Garcia family got SNAP benefits in Texas for the month of March. By April, they are working in Minnesota. If they apply for SNAP no later than April 30, the Minnesota SNAP office will give them a full month of SNAP benefits for April. This is because April 30 is within 30 days of March 31, the last day covered by the SNAP benefits the Garcias got in Texas.
Emergency vendor payments that state or local welfare agencies make for migrant or seasonal farm workers do not count as income when the farm workers are in the job stream. [7 U.S.C. § 2014(k)(2)(E); 7 C.F.R. § 273.9(c)(1)(i)(D) and (ii)(C)] For example, if the welfare office pays a hotel for a room for the household while the farm worker waits for the crops to be ready, that would not count as income. It also would not count as income if the welfare office paid a garage to fix the farm worker’s car or a gas station to provide gas or oil while the farm worker is in the job stream.
Unlike most CalFresh (SNAP) households, migrant and seasonal farm workers do not have to turn in regular reports to the welfare office. [7 U.S.C. § 2015(c)(1)(A)(ii); 7 C.F.R. §§ 273.12(a)(4)(i) and 273.21(b)(1)(ii).]
CalFresh offices should only count as income money that they can be reasonably certain households will get in the next month. [7 C.F.R. § 273.10(c)(1)(i); MPP §§ 63-503.212(a), 63-503.242(a).] The CalFresh office should not act as if a household will get income just because there is work in the area. Most loans, such as travel advances, do not count as income. [7 C.F.R. § 273.9(c)(4); MPP § 63-502.2.] Travel advances also are excluded as reimbursements. [7 C.F.R. § 273.9(c)(5)(i)(A); MPP § 63-502.2.] Money earned by students under 18 does not count as income. [7 C.F.R. § 273.9(c)(7); MPP § 63-502.2.]
Migrant and seasonal farm workers can count the costs of keeping up a home that their household uses part of the year, such as a winter home in Texas or Florida, to get an excess shelter cost deduction. [7 C.F.R. § 273.9(d)(6)(ii)(D); MPP § 63-502.35 and 502.36.] This home does not count as a resource even when the household is away working. [7 C.F.R. § 273.8(e)(1); MPP § 63-501.3.]
The car, truck or van that migrant or seasonal farm workers drive to get from one job to another does not count as a resource no matter what it is worth. [7 C.F.R. § 273.8(e)(3)(i)(C); MPP § 63-501.52.] Cars, trucks and vans that migrant or seasonal farm workers live in also do not count as resources. [7 C.F.R. § 273.8(e)(1), (e)(3)(i)(D); MPP §§ 63-501.3, 63-501.52.]
Migrant and seasonal farm workers can get CalFresh benefits even after they quit a job if they quit at or near the end of the season or at some other time when many farm workers normally change jobs. [7 C.F.R. § 273.7(n)(3)(viii).]
Households have a right to get and turn in applications by mail. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(c); MPP § 63-300.3.] If the household has trouble getting to the CalFresh office for an interview, it may have a right to be interviewed somewhere closer to home or over the telephone. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(e)(2); MPP § 63-300.4.] Households have the right to file applications the same day they go to the CalFresh office even if it is very busy. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(c)(1); MPP § 63-300.31.]
Migrant and seasonal farm worker households can qualify for expedited (emergency) CalFresh benefits within three calendar days under the same rules that apply to other households. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(i)(1); MPP § 63-301.51.] Migrant and seasonal farm workers with $100 or less in cash, money in the bank, stocks, bonds, and other things they can turn into cash quickly (“liquid resources”) may also qualify for expedited service if:
   * They received all their income for the month before the day they applied for CalFresh [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(i)(1)(ii), 273.10(e)(3)(i); MPP §§ 63-301.51, 63-503.43.]; and
   * They cannot get any more income from that source [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2(i)(1)(ii), 273.10(e)(3)(ii), (iii); MPP §§ 63-301.51, 63-503.43.]; and
   * They do not expect to get more than $25 for at least the next 10 days. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2(i)(1)(ii), 273.10(e)(3)(ii) and (iii); MPP §§ 63-301.51, 63-503.43.]
If the migrant or seasonal farm worker household is eligible for expedited service, the CalFresh office must not count any income that it has not yet received when it calculates the household’s first monthly CalFresh allotment. [7 C.F.R. § 273.10(e)(iv).]
Migrant and seasonal farm workers can get expedited CalFresh benefits for the month they apply without giving the CalFresh office any proof (“verification”) except I.D. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(i)(4); MPP § 63-301.54.] Migrant and seasonal farm workers who qualify for expedited service do not have to get proof or verification from employers or other people in other states until it is time for them to get the third month’s CalFresh benefits. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(i)(4); MPP § 63-301.546.] However, the household should turn in verification to the CalFresh office as soon as it gets it.
The CalFresh office must give migrant and seasonal farm workers faster fair hearings so that they get decisions before they leave the area. [7 C.F.R. § 273.15(i)(2); MPP § 22-045.21.] When a CalFresh office denies a household expedited service, the household has a right to a meeting with the CalFresh office within two days. [7 C.F.R. § 273.15(d)(2); MPP § 63-804.4.] This is called an “agency conference.” (See the sections about notices and fair hearings for more details on hearings and agency conferences.)
If enough low-income households in an area do not speak English, the CalFresh office must have forms in those households’ languages and hire staff to translate. [7 C.F.R. § 272.4(b); MPP § 63-202.21]. (See the section about people who do not speak English for more information.) This is true even if most or all of the households that do not speak English are migrant farm workers who will soon leave the area. CalFresh offices may not discriminate because of race, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, or religious or political beliefs. [7 C.F.R. § 272.6; 7 C.F.R. § 15.3; MPP §§ 21-101, 21-203.] Applicants and recipients have the right to complain to USDA if they think they are being treated unfairly by the CalFresh office.
In California, CalFresh applicants and recipients can file a civil rights complaint directly with the state agency by completing a discrimination complaint form and mailing it to the California Department of Social Services, Civil Rights Bureau, P.O. Box 944243, MS 15-70, Sacramento, CA 94244-2430, within 180 days from the date the discrimination happened.
Some legal immigrants can qualify for CalFresh benefits. [7 C.F.R. § 273.4; MPP § 63-405.] (See the section about immigrant eligibility for CalFresh and counting a legal immigrant’s quarters of work for more details.) Some members of a household may be able to get CalFresh even if other members do not qualify because of their immigration status. [7 C.F.R. § 273.11(c)(2).] Immigrants who had people sponsor them to get into the county may have some of the income and resources of the sponsor counted as income and resources for their households, but there are exceptions to this rule. [7 C.F.R. § 273.4(c); 8 C.F.R. §§ 213a and 299; MPP § 63-403.2.] (For more details, see the chart explanation the treatment of income and resources of persons excluded from the CalFresh household.)
Each individual in the household who is applying to receive CalFresh must provide information about their immigration status and Social Security number. This information will be provided to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for the sole purpose of determining eligibility for benefits, and cannot be used for immigration enforcement unless a criminal violation is involved. Individuals who are not seeking to receive CalFresh themselves must provide accurate information about their income, but do not need to provide any information about their legal status or Social Security number. If they chose not to provide this information, they will simply be treated as “ineligible” immigrants. [See 7 C.F.R. § 273.4(b)(2).]

California exception
As a practical matter, for immigrants living in California and waiting to qualify for federal CalFresh benefits, there is no immediate need to count “quarters of work” to determine eligibility for CalFresh benefits. The California Food Assistance Program (CFAP), a special California-specific program that provides state-funded CalFresh benefits for resident legal immigrants, provides benefits to immigrants in the absence of their qualifying for federal CalFresh benefits. Just saying.
(So, hold that thought as you review the rest of this page.)
How the 2002 Farm Bill reset the effect of the “40 quarters of work” requirment
The 2002 Farm Bill significantly expanded SNAP eligibility for non-citizens residing in the U.S. in a qualified alien status for five years.  Generally, an LPR must have worked for 10 years cumulatively before becoming eligible to participate in SNAP. Since an LPR becomes eligible for SNAP after residing in the United States for five years, whether or not he or she has any qualifying quarters as a result of the 2002 Farm Bill, the 40-quarter requirement is now only applicable in limited cases. Lawful permanent residents who have been in the United States less than five years may claim 40 qualifying quarters of work by claiming quarters credited from the work of a parent earned before the applicant became 18 or from the work of a spouse to be eligible for SNAP. See, generally, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Guidance on Non-Citizen Eligibility (“Federal Guidance”), page 14.
For example, if a legal immigrant and her spouse each have three full years of work credits (24 quarters) and her parents had four or more full years of work (16 quarters) before she turned 18, she would become SNAP eligible after her third year of residency.
Federal requirements for counting work quarters
For federal SNAP benefits, many non-citizens must pass two thresholds before becoming eligible for benefits: First, the non-citizen must gain qualified immigrant status. Second, many qualified immigrants must also pass a second condition [See Federal Guidance, page 2; 7 C.F.R. § 273.4(a)(6)(ii)(A).] Although less likely than in the past, one of those second conditions may be that the LPR immigrant has to document she has 40 qualifying work quarters.
See the section about who is a “qualified immigrant” for related information about immigrant eligibility.
To get 40 quarters of work to qualify for federal SNAP benefits, the legal immigrant household member can count quarters she has worked, quarters her spouse has worked, and quarters her parents worked before she turned 18. [7 C.F.R. § 273.4(a)(6)(ii)(A).] There are many work requirement exceptions and conditions that apply. [Id.]
Of note, these include work legally covered by Social Security, regardless of the person’s immigration status at the time the work was performed. [See Federal Guidance, page 19.] Some non-covered earnings, like certain agricultural earnings, also count. [SSA POMS SI 00502.135.] However, quarters worked in another country cannot be counted.
Special rules apply in divorce situations as well. If the immigrant is found eligible for benefits using both hers and her spouse’s work quarters, then a subsequent divorce would not change her eligibility status. However, if SNAP eligibility has not been determined at the time of divorce, then her spouse’s work quarters would not count towards meeting her 40-quarters of work requirement. [7 C.F.R. § 273.4(a)(6)(ii)(A)(1).]
If the total number of quarters from the legal immigrant’s work, their spouse’s work and their parents’ work (before the legal immigrant turned 18) is 40 or more, the immigrant applicant can get federal SNAP benefits. [7 C.F.R. § 273.4(a)(6)(ii)(A).] The legal immigrant’s spouse and children can also count the quarters one has worked in order for them to get to 40 quarters of work. [Id.]
A legal immigrant household member cannot count any quarter during which they received any “federal means-tested benefit.” This includes SNAP benefits like federal CalFresh benefits, SSI, CalWORKs (California’s TANF program) and non-emergency Medicaid. [7 C.F.R. § 273.4 (a)(6)(ii)(A)(2).] Similarly, a parent’s or spouse’s quarters are not countable if they received any federal means-tested public benefits in that quarter. [Id.]
The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has determined that CalFresh benefits are “federal means-tested public benefits.” But once an immigrant satisfies the 40 quarters of work requirement, eligibility for CalFresh will not be revoked by one’s applying for means-tested public benefits. [7 C.F.R. § 273.4 (a)(6)(ii)(A)(2).]
Child nutrition programs are excluded from the definition of “federal means-tested public benefits” for purposes of this provision. These include: School Lunch, School Breakfast, Summer Food Service and Child and Adult Care Food Programs.
Missing or unknown work quarters
If someone is a lawful permanent resident and thinks they have 40 quarters of work in the United States, the SNAP office will have to verify the quarters of work. The SNAP office will ask the Social Security Administration for the legal immigrant’s records. The legal immigrant will have to sign a release form so that Social Security can give the SNAP office her records. If the legal immigrant household member wants to count the quarters of her spouse or parent, the they would also have to sign a release. If the legal immigrant’s Social Security records do not show 40 quarters of work but an applicant thinks she has 40 quarters, she can ask the Social Security Office to assist her in filling in the missing records. [See, generally, Federal Guidance, p. 14.]
To fill in any missing records, the legal immigrant will have to get proof of work. One can try to prove work by collecting old pay stubs, getting statements from old employers or getting statements from other workers who worked with the person at the job.
The Social Security office may not have the most recent quarters someone worked because it takes some time for the Social Security records to be updated. In that situation, the legal immigrant will have to give the SNAP office other proof of her work. If she does not want to wait for Social Security to fix her records, she can request a fair hearing. (See the sections about notices and fair hearings for more details about how that process works.). At the fair hearing, the SNAP applicant can present proof of her past work.
There are other helpful reasons for establishing 40 quarters of credit. For example, a legal immigrant can get an exemption to sponsor deeming if she has 40 quarters of work. Further, if someone has 40 quarters of work and is attempting to immigrate, she would not need an affidavit of support filed on her behalf. Visit the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) for more information.

Overview of immigrant eligibility in California
In California, qualified immigrants, victims of trafficking, “U” visa applicants or holders, and a few other groups can get CalFresh benefits. Two programs allow this. The regular, federally funded CalFresh Program, and the state-funded California Food Assistance Program (CFAP).  The regular CalFresh Program restricts CalFresh eligibility to immigrants who fall into certain categories. In contrast, CFAP is open to otherwise qualified immigrants.  See California Food Assistance Program for details about CFAP.
Aside from who is eligible, the regular CalFresh Program and CFAP differ only in who pays for the benefits. The federal government pays for CalFresh, and the state pays for CFAP. For a listing of immigrant eligibility in California’s SNAP program, see the somewhat overwhelming, 187-page CDSS “Noncitizen Eligibility Reference Guide,” published as ACIN I-102-10.
FNS has this handy dandy chart outlining SNAP policy on Non-Citizen Eligibility. FNS has also published its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Guidance on Non-Citizen Eligibility (June 2011) (“FNS Guidance”), which includes a more detailed listing of immigrant eligibility.
Immigrants (and others) who do not want to get benefits for themselves may “opt out.” [See ACL 23-57.]  This happens automatically if the person fails to provide a Social Security number (SSN). [MPP § 63-402.22.] They will still be part of any household with which they buy and cook food, but they will not get benefits. They will be treated as excluded household members, and a pro-rata portion of their income is counted against the rest of the household.
Federal SNAP requirements
Many qualified immigrants can get federal SNAP benefits (regular CalFresh benefits) if they are otherwise eligible. The general rule is that immigrant adults are eligible for get regular CalFresh benefits after they have been in the United States in qualified-immigrant status for five years. That said, some immigrants are eligible for benefits right away. [8 U.S.C. § 1612(a)(2), 7 C.F.R. § 273.4.(a)(6)(ii).] Children, people in certain humanitarian immigration categories (such as refugees and asylees, and victims of trafficking), people with military connections, people with credit for 10 years of work history in the United States, and persons receiving disability benefits, are eligible right away. See, generally, FNS Guidance.
Most legal immigrants must (1) be a qualified immigrant, AND (2) meet a condition that allows the qualified immigrant to get federal CalFresh benefits. The federal SNAP regulations provide that if a person is originally found to be an eligible immigrant, a subsequent adjustment to a more limited status does not override the eligibility. If the eligibility expires, however, the agency must determine if the person is eligible under another status. [7 C.F.R. § 273.4(a)(5)(iv).]
Who is a “qualified immigrant”?
Qualified immigrants are:
   * Lawful permanent residents (LPRs), including Amerasian immigrants; or
   * Refugees, asylees, persons granted withholding of deportation, conditional entry (prior to April 1, 1980), or paroled for at least one year; or
   * Cuban/Haitian entrants; or
   * Adults or minors subject to severe trafficking, or their spouse/parents/children; or
   * Certain battered spouses and children.
   * Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrants
This is not a comprehensive list, for a complete listing see the federal regulations. [8 U.S.C. § 1641(b), (c); 7 C.F.R. § 273.4(a)(6)(i).]
Be forewarned: California regulations have not been amended comprehensively and so erroneously still list certain categories of immigrants who are actually eligible for the federal SNAP program as only eligible to CFAP.
There is a brief period of SNAP eligibility for Iraqis and Afghanis employed by the United States, as translators and interpreters, with Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) who can qualify for CalFresh benefits. The time period for eligibility is six to eight months depending on eligibility criteria. [ACL 08-35.]
People in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program are not eligible for CalFresh or CFAP.
Qualified immigrants must also meet ONE of the following conditions to receive regular CalFresh benefits:
   * Have been in the United States as a qualified immigrant for five years (the years do not have to be consecutive); or
   * Be under 18; or
   * Be receiving disability-related assistance (as defined in the CalFresh Program; see the section about how “disabled” is defined); or
   * Have one of the following immigration statuses:
   * Refugee
   * Asylee
   * Person granted withholding of deportation or removal
   * Cuban or Haitian entrant
   * Victim of trafficking
   * Amerasian
   * Lawful permanent resident (LPR) who used to have one of the above immigration statuses
   * Parolee under Immigration and Naturalization Act section 212(d)(5) with a duration of parole of at least one year (a DT code is sufficient verification of parolee status, see ACL 24-27); or
   * Be a veteran of the United States military, or a member of the United States military, or a spouse or child of a person in the military or a veteran; or
   * Be a lawful permanent resident (LPR) with at least 40 quarters of work in the United States; or
   * Be a member of a Hmong or Laotian tribe that fought with the United States military during the Vietnam War, who is lawfully residing in the United States; or
   * On August 22, 1996, have been 65 years or older and lawfully residing in the United States (i.e., born before August 22, 1931);
   * Be an American Indian with certain rights to cross the border between the United States and Canada or Mexico; or
   * Be a noncitizen national (born in American Samoa or Swain’s Island).
[8 U.S.C. § 1612(a)(2); 7 C.F.R. § 273.4.]
In addition, the following categories of legal immigrants do NOT have to meet the qualified-immigrant test to receive regular CalFresh benefits:
   * Certain Hmong or Highland Laotians who are lawfully present in the United States, with their spouses and children;
   * Certain cross-border American Indians with treaty rights to cross between Canada or Mexico and the United States; and
   * Victims of a severe form of trafficking of persons, who are eligible to the same extent as refugees.
[8 U.S.C. 1612(a)(2)(K); 7 C.F.R. § 273.4.]
Individuals granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) are permitted to remain temporarily in the United States because their home nation is suffering under armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other extraordinary or temporary conditions. Any noncitizens granted TPS, unless in some other qualifying status, are not eligible to receive SNAP benefits. See FNS Guidance, page 9.Effective March 9, 2024, citizens of the Compact of Free Association states of Micronesia, Palau, and the Marshall Islands are eligible for federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits without a waiting period. [FNS Memo, July 12, 2024; ACL 24-61, August 9. 2024.]
Eligibility of Afghan immigrants
Afghan Humanitarian Parolees, and their spouse, children, parents and legal guardian, who are admitted into the United States between July 31, 2021 and September 30, 2023 are eligible for CalFresh.  They are not subject to the five year waiting period for refugees. They are eligible until March 31, 2023.  [ACWDL, January 30, 2023.]
Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders, Special Immigrant Conditional Permanent Residents, and Afghan Special Immigrant Lawful Permanent Residents are eligible for public benefits to the same extent as refugees if their status is established between July 31, 2021 and September 30, 2023.  [ACWDL, January 30, 2023.]
CDSS has provided an updated list of acceptable verification of status and an updated chart of acceptable verification of status.  [ACWDL, December 14, 2022.]
Eligibility of Ukranian immigrants
Ukranians and Non-Ukranian individuals paroled into the United States because of the war between February 24, 2022 and September 30, 2023 are eligible for CalFresh effective May 21, 2022, or date of parole whichever is later. UHPs paroled into the United States between October 1, 2023, and September 30, 2024, become eligible for CalFresh on April 24, 2024, or their date of parole whichever is later. UHPs paroled between October 1, 2023 and April 23, 2024 for the California Food Assistance Program (CFAP) if they have parolee status of one year or more. [ACWDL, June 28, 2024.]
Spouses, children of UHPs, and parents, legal guardians, and primary caregivers of UHPs who were unaccompanied minors, are eligible for CalFresh benefits if they are granted parole after
September 30, 2023.  [Id.]
Sponsor deeming
Immigrants who entered the United States after December 19, 1997 may have sponsors who are legally required to support them. In some cases, if the immigrant applies for SNAP benefits, the welfare office may consider the sponsor’s income and resources as if these were available to the immigrant. This consideration is called “sponsor deeming.”” The deeming requirements apply only to some lawful permanent residents whose sponsor has signed a legally binding affidavit of support on or after December 19, 1997 (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-864).
There are important exceptions to these deeming rules. [7 C.F.R. § 273.4(c); 8 C.F.R. §§ 213a and 299; FNS Guidance, page 31; MPP § 63-403.2.] (For related information, see the section about treatment of resources of a sponsored non-citizen.) There is no deeming if the immigrant is indigent. [See ACL 11-06 (indigency exception and required verification).]
The deeming rules for CFAP are more generous than the deeming rules for regular CalFresh benefits.
Verification of immigration status
The CalFresh office is required to verify the immigration status of individuals who are applying for CalFresh benefits, but may not require applicants to provide information about the citizenship or immigration status of any non-applicant. The CalFresh office may not deny benefits to an applicant because a non-applicant family or household member has not disclosed her citizenship or immigrant status. [FNS Guidance, page 22.]
If an applicant cannot provide acceptable verification of U.S. citizenship and the household can provide a reasonable explanation for the lack of verification, the CalFresh office must accept a signed statement, under penalty of perjury, from a third party. [FNS Guidance, page 23.]  Counties cannot limit the types of acceptable documentation of immigration status.  [ACWDL, December 2, 2021.]  ACWDL December 2, 2021 contains a list of acceptable immigration verification documentation for Afghan entrants.
For related information about verification of immigration status, see the U.S. Department of Justice position stated in its Interim Guidance on Verification of Citizenship, Qualified Alien Status and Eligibility Under Title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, 62 Fed.Reg. 61344 (November 17, 1997).
Public Charge
Public charge is the rule that it is more difficult for people who receive public benefits or might receive public benefits enter United States or to obtain lawful permanent resident status. The current public charge rule does not apply to food benefits including CalFresh. [See ACL 23-57.]

Transitional CalFresh (TCF) benefits program
The federal Transitional Food Stamp (TFS) program derives from the 2002 Food Stamp reauthorization law. It gives a state the option to provide up to five months of transitional food benefits to families that leave welfare. These families are not required to reapply or submit any additional paperwork or other information. In California the TFS program is called the Transitional CalFresh (TCF). It provides food benefits for five months to households that leave CalWORKs. [Welf. & Inst. Code § 18901.6; MPP § 63-504.13; see also 7 U.S.C. § 2020(s).]
The county determines eligibility for TCF without the households having to apply for it. [ACL 03-66.] TCF eligibility requires the household to be receiving CalFresh in the last month of CalWORKs cash assistance. Generally, a household is eligible for TCF each time it leaves CalWORKs. Prior TCF use does not preclude a household from using TCF again. [ACIN I-21-04, at No. 5.] Households receiving Kin-GAP are still eligible for TCF so long as the CalWORKs requirement is satisfied. A household also remains eligible for benefits after CalWORKs stops for other household members. [ACIN I-84-09E.] Households on TCF are covered by the Inter-County Transfer process. [ACL 13-78 (retracting prior instructions excluding TCF cases from the transfer process).]
CalWORKs household that are eligible for Transitional CalFresh include CalWORKs households that are discontinued because the household exceeded income or resource limits, asked to close their case, a parent timed out or a child aged out, or disqualified because of a CalWORKs rule change.  [ACL 20-129.]
A TCF household’s CalFresh amount is the same as the amount it received while on CalWORKs, adjusted for the decrease in household income due to CalWORKs grant loss. [7 U.S.C. § 2020(s)(3)(A); 7 C.F.R. § 273.27(a); MPP § 63-504.132(a); FNS Questions and Answers Regarding the Food Stamp Program Certification Provisions of the 2002 Farm Bill, § 4115-4.] The TCF amount remains the same even if a household member become ineligible for CalFresh benefits. This includes the loss of CalFresh benefits due to receipt of SSI (Supplemental Security Income) benefits; or becomes incarcerated (see ACIN I-84-09) during the TCF period. If some, but not all the members, of the TCF household leave and are granted CalWORKs (or CalFresh benefits) in another household, the TCF benefits will continue but be adjusted to remove the absent members.
Example: Family A is getting TCF for four people. Two people of those people leave to set up a new, separate CalWORKs household elsewhere, family B. The TCF benefits payable to family A remain, but lowered to two people. Family B could get CalFresh for themselves. The date family A begins to receive the the pro-rated amount is the 1st of the month after family B is authorized to receive aid. [ACIN I-84-09.]
When the TCF ends, California has chosen to use the recertification process to transition the household to regular CalFresh benefits without a break in aid. [7 U.S.C. § 2020(s)(4); 7 C.F.R. § 273.27; MPP § 63-504.132(d); ACL 11-70; ACL 03-66 at 2.]
A TCF household also may apply for regular CalFresh benefits during its transitional period or after TCF benefits stop, if the household did not recertify. [7 U.S.C. § 2020(s)(6); ACL 11-70; ACL 03-66 at 2.] This is not always a good idea unless the household changes will result in increased benefits. If approved for regular CalFresh benefits, TCF ends and all CalFresh program requirements apply. This includes the use of current income and resources to determine eligibility which may reduce the benefit amount. [7 U.S.C. § 2020(s)(6); ACL 03-66 at 2.] ACL 11-70 and ACL 20-129 require counties to inform households if the benefits would be lower, and allow the household to withdraw the application.
California Food Assistance Program recipients are eligible for five months of transitional benefits in the same way as CalFresh recipients are eligible for Transitional CalFresh.  {ACL 23-57.] For CFAP, that benefit is called Transitional CFAP.
TCF disqualifications
If a household loses CalWORKs or CalFresh benefits due to a disqualification or sanction, the household may lose TCF eligibility. A household may also become TCF ineligible if it does not provide the necessary information during eligibility determinations, periodic reports and redeterminations. [7 U.S.C. § 2020(s)(5); 7 C.F.R. § 273.12(f)(4); 7 C.F.R. § 273.26(c); MPP § 63-504.131(b); ACL 13-88.]
This disqualification applies only to the violating member of the household. Some reasons for disqualification include: Intentional Program Violation (IPV); failure to comply with a work requirement; serving a “comparable disqualification under 7 C.F.R. § 273.11(k); receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI); being an ineligible immigrant; or being a fleeing felon. A household can also be terminated for failure to complete a required periodic report (such as California’s SAR-7 reporting form). [7 C.F.R. § 273.26(c).] Other reasons for TCF ineligibility include being approved for benefits in another state, being ineligible for CalWORKs because of immigration status, disqualified for knowing transfer to resources to maintain CalFresh eligibility, disqualified for duplicate CalFresh participation, disqualified from CalFresh for being a fleeing felon, or being in violation of conditions of probation or parole. [ACL 20-129.]
Households (or members) that are approved for either TANF or SNAP benefits elsewhere are also not eligible. Households which move out of California can still receive TCF benefits. (ACIN I-41-10 corrects and overrides MPP § 63-504.131(a) in this regard.) It does not matter if the person would otherwise be ineligible for CalFresh benefits — e.g. becoming an SSI recipient. For a disqualification to affect TCF eligibility, the disqualification needs to relate to, be the basis for stopping CalWORKs.
The California regulation says that TCF is not available to a household that loses CalWORKs or CalFresh benefits due to a CalWORKs or CalFresh sanction – without specifying that the CalWORKs sanction must also impact CalFresh benefits eligibility. The correct rule was made clear in ACL 13-88.]
Reporting requirements
TCF households are not required to report changes in their circumstances during the transitional period, including address or income changes. [MPP § 63-504.132(b); ACIN I-21-04, Question and Answer 17.] The county calculates and issues benefits based on information that it already has. Contact with the household is not required. [MPP § 63-504.132(a); ACL 03-66 at 2.] If a TCF household member leaves for another CalFresh benefits household, the county will reduce the grant benefit as well as the departing individual’s income. [ACL 08-22.] If the household change would increase the CalFresh amount (i.e., someone moves into the household) then it may be advantageous to reapply for regular CalFresh benefits. [ACIN I-21-04, Question and Answer 12.]
Certification period
When the household becomes eligible for TCF, the county will adjust the household’s certification period to coincide with the end of the transitional benefit period. [MPP § 63-504.132(d); ACL 03-66 at 2.] When TCF, the household will be given the regular certification period. When recertifying at the end of the TCF period, all the regular recertification rules set forth at MPP § 63-504.6 apply.
Forms and notices
The county must send a notice to tell a household when its TCF begins. In some cases, the county must also send notice that the CalFresh certification period has either been extended or shortened to coincide with the end of the transitional period. [MPP § 63-504.132(d); ACL 03-66 at 2.]  New forms are attached to ACL 20-129.  Counties are to send a Notice of Expiration (NEC) one month before benefits expire (i.e., expire in the fourth month of the five-month TCF eligibility period). [ACL 11-70.] In order to avoid a break in aid, households must complete the recertification process as soon as possible. To recertify, a household must complete an application and interview before the 15th day of the last TCF month. Applicants must also submit proof of income and other relevant information 10 days prior to the interview. The counties are required to schedule interviews so that households have at least 10 days to provide the required verification before the certification period expires. [ACL 11-70.]
State regulation MPP §§ 63-504.132(d) and (e) are void to the degree those provisions are inconsistent with ACL 11-70, which reflects the new, controlling federal regulation, 7 CFR § 273.27.
If the transitional CalFresh benefits are ending for any reasons other than the expiration of the five-month transitional period, the county must send a timely notice of action, 10 days before terminating transitional benefits. [MPP § 63-504.132(e); ACIN I-21-04.]
Terminating TCF benefits
In the final month of the transitional benefit period, the state agency must do one of the following: Either clarify “unclear information,” or recertify the household. [7 C.F.R. § 273.31(a).] To gain clarity, the state agency can send a Request for Contact (RFC) to resolve unclear information needed to determine benefits. California’s practice is to “recertify” the household. If the household does not submit a new application to recertify prior to the end of the TCF benefits, the household will be terminated. The NEC notices sent to “recertify” informs the household that benefits will be discontinued for failure to comply with the recertification process.


The following is a concise summary of basic eligibility in the CalFresh program:
   * “Households” get CalFresh (SNAP) benefits.
   * In general, to get CalFresh benefits, the household’s gross income must be less than the gross-income eligibility standard — 130% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). However, under California’s modified categorical eligibility standard, eligibility can go up to 200% of FPL.  [CDSS CalFresh Eligibility and Issuance Requirements.] If the household includes an elderly or disabled person, the gross income limit is 165% of the FPL but the family does not need to meet the net income test.  [Id.] If all members of the household are elderly and/or disabled, then the household does not have to meet any gross income limit.  [Id.]
   * To qualify, the household’s net income must be less than the net-income eligibility standard — 100% of the FPL. To determine net income, there are various deductions and credits used to reduce the household’s overall earned or other income.
   * After all deductions and credits are applied, and it has been determined the household’s net income is below the net-income eligibility standard, these various deductions and credits are also used to calculate the amount of benefits the household will receive.
   * Most CalFresh households qualify for benefits regardless of what property resources they own. In most other states, to qualify for SNAP benefits the household cannot own property whose value exceeds the SNAP program’s resource limit. But, as a practical matter in California, the SNAP resource limits do not affect CalFresh eligibility because the definition of “categorical eligibility” has been expanded to include pretty much any household that would otherwise qualify for benefits.
   * All adults in the household must comply with the CalFresh program’s work requirements unless they are exempt. In California, that is registering for work, but, except in counties that no longer have a waiver from the Able Bodied Adults Without Dependants requirements, participation is voluntary.
   * In California, all qualified immigrants are eligible for CalFresh benefits or the California Food Assistance Program for certain legal immigrants who are ineligible for CalFresh.
There are other food and nutrition programs not described in this Guide, such as the School Breakfast and Lunch Program. There is also a program for pregnant women, lactating women and young children called the Supplemental Nutrtition Program for Women, Infant and Children (WIC). For more information on WIC, see the WIC Program Detailed Description; the WIC Policy and Procedure Manual; Federal WIC Laws and Regulations; California WIC Laws; and California WIC Regulations.  Another federal nutrition program is the Food Distribution on Indian Reservations program.




What is a “household”
CalFresh benefits are given to “households.” [7 C.F.R. §§ 271.2(a), 274.1(a); MPP § 63-101.1.] Who is in the CalFresh household determines whose income to count, and the amount of benefits the household receives.
A “household” can be a person living alone or a group of people living together who buy food and make meals together. [7 C.F.R. § 273.1(a); MPP § 63-402.1.] Members of a CalFresh household do not need to be related. A person who lives with others, but customarily buys and prepares food separate and apart from others, can be a separate CalFresh household. [Id.] As explained, below, even if related to other members of the household, an “elderly and disabled” person can also be a separate household.
There is no age-requirement threshold to get benefits as your own household. [ACIN I-39-13.] There are some age-based rules about household composition regarding people who cannot have separate households. Households with minor children (or certain children under 19) who meet federal TANF work requirements, can get a small supplemental benefit. [ACL 13-71.]
The state agency must ensure that no one gets duplicate aid. [7 CFR § 272.4(e)(1).] State agencies are required to perform “death matches” against the Death Master File at Social Security. “Death matches” with Social Security Administration data must be conducted at the time of application and at most once per year. [7 C.F.R § 272.14.]
State agencies are also required to perform “prisoner verifications” to check whether the person has been incarcerated longer than 30 days. Prisoner verification must be done at the time of application and recertification. [See FNS memorandum, Routine Checks with Neighboring States to Prevent Duplicate Participation and Performing Deceased and Prisoner Verification Matches (November 15, 2011); see also, 7 CFR § 272.13.] Minor children, and single person households who have undergone a face-to-face (in person) interview are exempt from this verification requirement. [7 C.F.R § 273.13(b)(1).]
For households with 50/50 custody arrangements, the county must ensure that children do not receive aid in two different households. [MPP § 63-402.15.] If both parent’s households are eligible, the county needs to decide which household will be given CalFresh benefits for the child. If the child eats more meals with one parent, that would be the eligible household. Otherwise, the first to apply for aid would be the aided household. The parents can also decide among themselves who should be the recipient household. [MPP §§ 63-402.151(a-c).]
Parents with less than 50% custody could seek additional support for the food needs of their child through the family law court system. Family courts can address the issue of one parent getting full CalFresh benefits.
The CalFresh office will treat some people as one household even if they do not buy food and prepare meals together. (See the chart listing special rules for students, strikers, roomers, boarders, and others in unusual situations.) There may also be people in the household who buy and cook together who cannot get aid because they are “excluded” or who opt not to get aid.
Once the composition of the household is determined, the income and resources of its members are used to determine eligibility. If no exceptions apply, the household must have a gross income below 130% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), and a net income below 100% FPL. Many exceptions exist, and a few are detailed below. [7 C.F.R. § 273.9.]
For related information, see the section about specific types of households and whether they are or are not categorically eligibile.
Noncitizen opt-out from applying for CalFresh
Immigrant members of a household who do not want to apply for CalFresh benefits may “opt-out,” and should be treated as “non-applicants.”  [See ACL 11-06.]  Such members need not disclose their immigration status, but they must still answer questions affecting the eligibility of the “applicant” household.  See Policy Guidance Regarding Inquiries into Citizenship, Immigration Status and Social Security Numbers, at page 3. This option allows non-citizens to choose not to apply for CalFresh, and therefore not disclose their immigration status on the application.  Opting out does not affect CalFresh eligibility of other members of the household except that a pro-rata share of the non-applicant’s income is counted as income for the remaining household members.  [MPP §§ 63-402.22, 63-504.442.]
Multiple households in the same house
As explained, above, CalFresh benefits are granted based on the concept of the “household.” That said, there can be more than one CalFresh household under the same roof. Having more than one CalFresh household under one roof can result in more benefits for each household.
The test of whether people can be in a group household is whether the group purchases food and prepares meals together. Groups that buy and prepare their food together can split off — as long as they are not required otherwise to be in a particular household — by buying or preparing their food separately, and informing the county welfare case worker that the former, larger single group wants to be aided separately as different, smaller groups.
As of 2015, a household of four people could receive a maximum benefit amount of $657. However, if the same household applied as two separate households, each household could receive a maximum benefit of $357. Combined, the two households collectively could receive up to $714 per month. In this example, by splitting the household, the family would receive an additional $67 per month.
Having more than one CalFresh household can protect one’s benefits if someone else in the house does not fit the CalFresh eligibility rules. For example, if a household member is not doing the work requirements or has too much income or resources.
Other times, however, it is better for a larger group of people to apply as one CalFresh household. As described, below, there are rules allowing someone who is elderly and disabled to constitue his own CalFresh household. But if the family has a large rent or utility bill, little income — and the household includes an elderly and disabled member — it may be better to apply with everyone together in one household because the eligibility requirements would be eased. For example, such households are not subject to the upper limit or “cap” on their excess shelter deduction. This means that the total amount of rent and utilities can be subtracted from the household’s income, even if the shelter costs are much higher than the shelter cap. Such households are also not subject to the gross income test for eligibility, easing the income restrictions of getting on the CalFresh program.
Special rule for households with an “elderly and disabled” member
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) interprets the “separate household” rule in 7 C.F.R. § 273.1(b)(2) to mean that elderly and disabled individuals residing with others can actually constitute a separate household, even when the elderly and disabled individuals “purchase and prepare meals” together with those with whom they live. [See, FNS Memorandum, Separate Household Status for Disabled Persons (June 12, 2006).]
However “the income of those with whom they reside (excluding the income of the elderly and disabled person) must be no more than 165 percent of the Federal poverty income guideline.” [7 C.F.R. § 273.1(b)(2); MPP § 63-402.17.]
People who cannot be a seperate household
See, generally, MPP § 63-402.14 (“separate household shall not be granted to…”).
   * Children under 18 parentally controlled by a non-parent. [MPP § 63-402.141]. However, emancipated minors are not considered children. [MPP § 63-102(p)(1)(A)], and minors may rebut the parental-control finding. [MPP § 63-102(p)(1)(B).]
   * Parents living with their natural, adopted or step children, or children living with their natural, adopted, or stepparents — unless the child is 22 years or older or is participating in the other parent’s CalFresh benefits household. [MPP § 63-402.142.]
   * Spouses living in the same household. [MPP § 63-402.143.]
   * Individuals or groups living together if they are residents of an institution or residents of a commercial boarding house, or boarders [7 C.F.R. § 273.1(b)(3).
There are numerous definitional exceptions to the the foregoing rules about who is or is not a resident of an “institution” or a “boarder.” For example:
   * For institution exceptions, see MPP § 63-402.4. Certain group living situations are not defined as “institutions.” This includes federally subsidized housing for the elderly; drug and alcohol residential treatment centers; disabled or blind Title II recipients in group living arrangements; domestic violence shelters; foster family homes (but not group homes, unless the program is for disabled youth and meets the requirements of MPP § 63-402.43); and homeless shelters. (See subsections of MPP § 63-402.4 for specific rules.)
   * For boarder exceptions, see MPP § 63-402.3. “Boarders” are ineligible to participate in the CalFresh program independent of the household providing the board. Boarders can get CalFresh benefits with the owner of the boarding house, at the owner’s request. Generally, foster children are treated as boarders. [MPP § 63-402.322.] The rules define a boarder as one receiving some food and lodging for reasonable compensation. Unless included in the household at the owner’s request, a boarder’s income and resources do not count against a household. However, the money boarders pay does count as income for the household. Those who do not fulfill the requirements to be a boarder are treated as part of the larger household. [MPP §§ 63-402.322(a-b).]
   * AB 12 Youth exception — And then there is the further exception to the “boarders” rule for “AB 12 youth” in “extended foster care” living in a supervised independent living placement. “AB 12 youth” are “non-minor dependents.” By statute they are deemed to be living independently, so they do not fall into the foster-care/boarder rule. [See Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 11400(w), 11402(i).] If they purchase and prepare their food separately, they should qualify as a separate household. If they purchase and prepare their food with the supervising adult, they would be part of the larger CalFresh household.
All children and youth in foster care are automatically eligible for free school nutrition programs — regardless of the foster-care-borders exclusion. [See ACIN I-58-11.]For more mind-boggling details about how these and other special rules apply to a wide range of households with special circumstances, see special rules for those in unusual situations (chart).
Domestic Violence Survivors
A domestic violence survivor who is a resident of a shelter and whose current CalFresh household includes the abuser can apply for CalFresh as a separate household and may be eligible for an additional allotment of CalFresh once per month.  Shelter residents and their children can be aided as members of the former household and as members of a new household once per month.  [Welf. & Inst. Code § 18914.5; ACL 17-30.]  These rules apply to all domestic violence survivors regardless of gender or sex.  [ACIN I-09-18.]
If the domestic violence survivor is the head of household, the survivor may ask to close the former CalFresh case that included the abuser.  If the request is made is writing or in the presence of an eligibility worker, the change can be made with adequate notice.  If the request is made verbally, the county must provide both adequate and timely (10 days) notice.  [Id.]
Applications for persons aided in another household
A family may apply for CalFresh for someone who is already receiving CalFresh in another household.  In that situation, the county must verify with whom the individual shares the majority of his/her meals.  [ACIN I-21-12.]  If the county determines that the child should be aided in the applicant household; the county discontinues aid for the child in the former household mid-period and grants CalFresh benefits to the new household.  [Id.] If the household where the new member has moved is applying for CalFresh (as opposed to adding new member to an existing CalFresh household) the new applicant household may be entitled to get Expedited Service, if otherwise eligible, except for the new household member whose presence is in question.
When discontinuing the child from the first household, the county must provide that household with timely and adequate notice (10 days), and may not grant aid to the applicant household until the first of the month after the child’s current benefits have been discontinued.  [Id.]  Since reporting household composition changes is a voluntary mid-period report, no overissuance may be assessed on the current household based on their not reporting the child leaving the home outside of the semi-annual reporting timeframe, not requesting a mid-period discontinuance, or the inability of the county to discontinue aid due to timely notice requirements.  [Id.]
People on SSI, CalWORKs, General Assistance or Medi-Cal, with a prior felony drug conviction, or fleeing felons
   * Understanding “categorical eligibility”
   * People receiving SSI / SSP benefits can receive CalFresh starting June 1, 2019
   * CalWORKs, General Assistance and Medi-Cal recipients are almost always categorically eligible
   * When are CalWORKs and General Assistance households not categorically eligible?
   * People with a prior felony drug conviction
   * Fleeing felons and persons in violation of probation or parole
   * Sexual assault or murder convictions
Understanding “categorical eligibility”
To say a household is “categorically eligible” for CalFresh benefits means that the household has a characteristic that simplifies, lowers or eliminates a barrier to its participation in CalFresh. While categorical eligibiity does mean the household is presumptively “eligible” to participate in the program, it does not necessarily mean the CalFresh household automatically will receive benefits, nor does it necessarily dictate how much in benefits it will receive. But categorical eligibility is very important because it does make it easier for most low-income households to get CalFresh benefits.
In practice, what “categorical eligibility” generally means is that the household does not have to provide verification of certain information, such as: resources, gross and net income, a social security number, sponsored lien information, and residency. [MPP §§ 63-301.72, 63-301.822; 7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2(j)(2)(v) and (j)(4)(iii).]  Although counties must verify identity, the must do so using MEDS.  [ACL 19-44.]
Households in California receiving cash welfare assistance, such as CalWORKs or General Assistance (GA) benefits, have long been deemed categorically eligible for CalFresh. Since 2011, both cash-assistance and non-cash assistance CalFresh households have been considered “modified categorically eligible.” [See ACL 09-24 (Q&As); ACL 11-11 (expanding “modified categorical eligibility”); and ACL 12-62 (examples of “modified categorical eligibility”).] This categorization broadly exempts all resources in the determination of eligibility for households who meet all other CalFresh eligibility requirements.
More recently, “categorical eligibility” has been expanded to include essentially all CalFresh households — including making those on Medi-Cal categorically eligible [ACL 13-108] and expanding modified categorical eligibility to encompass households with an elderly or disabled member [ACL 13-32], and now — all but comprehensively — households with gross incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). [See ACL 14-56.]
See ACIN I-50-13 for a summary of of the eligibility rules that apply to “categorically” and “modified categorically” eligible recipients.  For related information about what constitutes a CalFresh “household,” see the section explaining that households receive CalFresh benefits.
People receiving SSI / SSP benefits can receive CalFresh starting June 1, 2019
Effective June 1, 2019,  SSI recipients in California will be eligible for CalFresh.  [ACL 18-90.]  SSI recipients can apply for CalFresh beginning May 1, 2019.
SSI/SSP recipients in ongoing households will be eligible for CalFresh at the household’s next periodic report, annual recertification following implementation, or when voluntarily requested by the household.  [Id.]  A new application will not be required to add an SSI/SSP recipient to an ongoing household.  [Id.]
SSI/SSP applicants or recipients can apply for CalFresh at the county welfare department office.  SSI/SSP applicants or recipients can also apply at a Social Security Administration office if all members of the household SSI are applicants or recipients.  [ACL 19-44.]
SSI recipients are categorically eligible for CalFresh.  [ACL 18-90, 19-44.]
The Social Security Administration (SSA) must inform SSI applicants or recipients of their right to apply for CalFresh at the SSA office or their right to apply at the county welfare department whenever a member of a household consisting of only SSI applicants or recipients conducts business with SSA. SSA will not assist households with both SSI and non-SSI members. [Id.]
SSA will screen all households for CalFresh eligibility.  [Id.]  Based on the screening, SSA must give the household the opportunity to apply for CalFresh.  [Id.]  If a household with only SSI applicants or recipients agrees, SSA will assist the household in submitting and completing a CalFresh application.  These household may also complete their annual recertification at the SSA office. [Id.]
SSA can use the GetCalFresh.org online application starting June 1, 2019.  If the application is submitted using GetCalFresh.org, the county must not require an additional signature from the household.  [Id.]  If a household wants to submit a paper application, SSA will assist the household in completing the written application and will submit it to the county within one business day of receipt of the signed application.  [Id.]
For either type of application, SSA then will provide the following information to the household in writing: 1) contact information for the county; 2) remaining actions to be taken to complete the application; 3) a statement that the household should be notified of their CalFresh eligibility determination within 30 days; 4) the household’s rights and responsibilities; and 5) information about how to get an EBT card.  [Id.]
The expedited service timeframe will begin the date the county receives the application.  [Id.]  SSA will prescreen the application for entitlement to expedited service.  [Id.]
If the household chooses to apply with the county, SSA will inform the household of their option to apply online or take the paper application to the county.  [Id.]
All SSI/SSP recipients will be considered elderly and/or disabled household members for CalFresh purposes. [Id.]  This means that these households will be certified for 24 months.  [Id.]  If the household has no earned income, the household will be for 36 months under the Elderly Simplified Application Project.  [Id.]
Income, resources and deductions of the SSI/SSP recipient will be considered when determining CalFresh eligibility.  [Id.]  Households in which all members of household receive SSI/SSP will be considered categorically eligible for CalFresh. [Id.]  This means that no additional verification is needed for resources, gross or net income, Social Security Number, sponsored immigrant information or residency.
Households will not be required to report termination of SSI/SSP mid-period.  [Id.]  However, if termination of SSI/SSP becomes known to the county it must take action mid-period.  [Id.]
As a result of eligibility of previously excluded SSI/SSP recipients, some households will have their CalFresh reduced.  The Supplemental Nutrition Benefits (SNB) program will provide state-funded nutrition benefits for households that include at least one SSI/SSP recipient and will have their CalFresh benefits reduced when the SSI/SSP recipient is added to the household to compensate for this CalFresh benefit reduction.  [ACL 18-91.]
SNB eligibility is determined on the effective date of the addition of the SSI/SSP recipient to the CalFresh household.  [Id.]  SNB eligibility will remain linked to the household.  [Id.]  The exception is SNB eligibility transfers to a new household for a domestic violence survivor who creates a separate household. [Id.]  The current SNB amount are in ACL 21-107.
Transitional CalFresh recipients may be eligibile for SNB if their benefits are reduced by adding a previously excluded SSI/SSP recipient to the household.  [Id.]
Pending CalFresh applications with a beginning date of aid in the month prior to the implementation date of CalFresh eligibility for SSI/SSP recipients can be eligible for SNB.  [Id.]
SNB eligibility will continue as long as the household continues to receive CalFresh and the at least one of the previously excluded SSI/SSP recipients remains in the household.  [Id.]  SNB eligibility will be redetermined at the household’s CalFresh recertification.  [Id.]  Counties must give separate notices of action regarding the SNB program.  [Id.]
As a result of eligibility of previously excluded SSI/SSP recipients, some households will have their CalFresh terminated.  The Transitional Nutrition Benefits (TNB) program will provide state-funded nutrition benefits for households that include at least one SSI/SSP recipient and will become ineligible for CalFresh benefits when the SSI/SSP recipient is added to the household. [ACL 18-92.]  A household that becomes ineligible for CalFresh for any other reason is not eligible for TNB.
Adding a new California Food Assistance Program eligible member to the household mid-period or at semi-annual report does not change the household’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance benefit.  A household’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance benefit does not change when a household members changes from CalFresh to CFAP.  [ACL 23-57.]
TNB eligibility is determined on the effective date of the addition of the SSI/SSP recipient to the CalFresh household.  [Id.]  The current TNB amounts are in ACL 21-107.
TNB recertifications are only once every 12 months, and the period to submit documents to restore benefits is extended to 90 days of the recertification due date.  [ACL 21-131.]  All TNB recertifications are suspended until November, 2023 while the changes to TNB recertification are programmed into the county welfare department computer system. [Id.]
TNB recertifications will begin in November, 2023.  [ACIN I-35-23.]  Counties must send the Notice of Recertification for the Transitional Nutrition Benefit Program (TNB 4) to TNB households in the month prior to the household’s original TNB renewal month, starting in October 2023 for the November renewals.  Recertifications will be for 12 months.  [Id.]  TNB households are not required to report mid-period or complete a periodic report to maintain eligibility. [Id.]
If a TNB household is discontinued for failure to complete the renewal, benefits must be restored back to the date of termination if the recertification and all required documents are submitted within 90 days of the discontinuance. [Id.]
Pending CalFresh applications with a beginning date of aid in the month prior to the implementation date of CalFresh eligibility for SSI/SSP recipients can be eligible for TNB. [ACL 18-92.]
TNB eligibility will continue as long as the household continues to include at least one of the previously excluded SSI/SSP recipients, the same individual continues to receive SSI/SSP and the household is ineligible for CalFresh. [Id.]
Counties are not required to act on information received during the TNB certification period except for the household being granted CalFresh. [Id.]
People who are in SSI suspense status are not considered to be receiving SSI and can get CalFresh benefits. [ACL 17-09; Riojas v. United States Department of Agriculture (N.D. Cal. 2016) 2016 WL 3566941.]
CalWORKs, General Assistance and Medi-Cal recipients are almost always categorically eligible
CalWORKs (California’s TANF program) and General Assistance (GA) (also known as General Relief or GR) recipients may be “categorically eligible,” i.e., automatically qualified for CalFresh benefits. [MPP §§ 63-102(c)(3); (g)(1)(A) and (p)(12), 63-301.7, 63-301.82; 7 U.S.C. § 2014(a); 7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2(j)(2) and (4).]
For a GA recipient to qualify for categorical treatment, the GA program must rely on income criteria at least as restrictive as the CalFresh program. The GA program must also provide benefits that are not limited to one-time emergency payments. [MPP § 63-301.821; 7 U.S.C. § 2014(a); 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(j)(4)(i).] If anyone in the household is institutionalized or disqualified from the CalFresh benefits program, the household will not be categorically eligible. [MPP § 63-301.734; 7 C.F.R. § 273.2 (j)(v)(2).]
If everyone in the household is eligible for CalFresh benefits and also receives either CalWORKs or GA, the household is categorically eligible. [MPP §§ 63-301.7, 63-301.82; 7 U.S.C. § 2014(a); 7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2(j)(2)(i) and (j)(4).] If anyone in the household gets, or is eligible to get, Medi-Cal, the household is also categorically eligible for CalFresh, provided it has a gross income at or below 200% of the FPL. [ACL 13-108.]
Individuals applying for CalWORKs can apply for CalFresh benefits at the time they apply for cash aid. See MPP § 63-301.6; 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(j)(1). The same holds true for people applying for General Assistance.MPP § 63-301.81; 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(j)(3)(i).
In determining categorical eligibility, CalWORKs and GA recipients include individuals whose applications have been approved but have yet to receive benefits, those whose benefits have been suspended or recouped, and those eligible for benefits but have yet to receive them because their grants are less than a minimum benefit level of $10. [MPP §§ 63-102(g)(1) and (p)(12); see also 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(j)(2)(iv).]
There are special rules about students getting CalFresh benefits. [7 C.F.R. § 273.5(a), (b); MPP § 63-406.1, 406.2.] In practice, the rules do not matter for “categorically eligible” CalWORKs households, since all CalWORKs household members can be students and still qualify for CalFresh benefits. [MPP § 63-406.215; 7 C.F.R. § 273.5(b)(3).] Household members who are students and are getting GA, however, cannot get CalFresh benefits unless they fall into one of the categories of students eligable for CalFresh benefits. [MPP § 63-406.2; 7 C.F.R. § 273.5(b).]
Effective on January 1, 2022, county staff must verbally screen new and renewing Medi-Cal applicants for CalFresh and provide the opportunity to apply for CalFresh if eligible. All CalFresh applicants must also be screened for entitlement to expedited service.  [ACL 21-52.]
Medi-Cal beneficiaries eligible for CalFresh include (but are not limited to) beneficiaries with Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) income less than or equal to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), non-MAGI income less than or equal to 200% of the FPL, and non-MAGI Aged, Blind, and Disabled (ABD) FPL less than or equal to 138%. If the beneficiary is not interested in CalFresh, then the county must inform them of an online and paper application for the program. [Id.]
Online Medi-Cal applications (SAWS and CalHEERS) already offer eligible beneficiaries applications to additional benefits programs at the same time. County staff are encouraged, but not required to verbally ask online applicants if they are interested in CalFresh.  [Id.]
Counties must cross-train staff who process Medi-Cal applications to perform CalFresh eligibility determinations.  [Id.]
Counties must designate a CalFresh liaison to establish CalFresh application referral procedures and establish outreach procedures to increase CalFresh enrollment among Medi-Cal applicants and beneficiaries. Counties must provide CDSS with contact information of these liaisons by January 1, 2022.  [Id.]  The deadline for counties to implement dual eligibility is extended to January 1, 2023.  [ACL 21-150.]
When are CalWORKs and General Assistance households not categorically eligible?
A CalWORKs household cannot be considered categorically eligible if:
   * Any household member is disqualified from getting CalFresh benefits due to an intentional program violation (IPV), fleeing felon status (see ACL 15-82), or fraud. [MPP § 63-301.741; 7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2(j)(2)(vii)(A), 273.16.] (This is because federal law requires all CalFresh household members to be getting public assistance); or
   * The entire household has been cut off CalFresh benefits for not turning in its required semi-annual reports (SAR). [MPP § 63-301.742.]
A General Assistance (GA) household cannot be considered categorically eligible if:
   * The household refuses to cooperate in providing information necessary for eligibility determination or review. [MPP § 63-301.824(a); 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(j)(4)(v)(A).];
   * The entire household has been cut off CalFresh benefits because the head of household fails to comply with work requirements. [MPP §§ 63-301.824(b), 63-407.1; 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(j)(4)(v)(B).];
   * The household is ineligible for CalFresh benefits because one of its members is participating in a strike at work; numerous exceptions apply. [See MPP § 63-301.8 for details; 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(j)(4)(v)(C).];
   * The household is ineligible because it knowingly has transferred resources to qualify for CalFresh benefits [MPP § 63-501.61; 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(j)(4)(v)(C).]
People with a prior felony drug conviction
Effective April 1, 2015, no person can be excluded from an assistance unit or be denied CalFresh or CalWORKs benefits because of a prior felony drug conviction. Two important All County Letters have been issued addressing this change: ACL 14-100 sets out in detail the rule changes, key implementation dates, applicable forms, as well as what is expected of local county welfare offices to facilitate eligibility and receipt of CalFresh benefits for individuals previously excluded. There is also the related ACL 14-92 explaining specific changes made to the CalFresh application form to conform to AB 1468 (2014).  Drug felons must comply with the terms of probation or parole, if applicable, including participation in a government recognized
drug treatment program, if required.  [ACL 14-100.]
Fleeing felons and persons in violation of probation or parole
Persons who are fleeing felons or are in violation of a condition of probation or parole are ineligible for CalFresh.  [7 C.F.R. § 273.11(n).]  The federal regulation allows the state to choose one of several methods to determine when a person is a fleeing felon. [Id.]  California has chosen that a person is considered a fleeing felon only if they have an outstanding warrant for their arrest in one one of three National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Uniform Offense Classification Codes: Escape, Flight-to-avoid, and Flight-escape.  [ACL 15-82.]  For purposes of CalFresh, an individual is only disqualified if they have an outstanding arrest warrant in one of those three classification codes. [Id.]
A person is only considered to be in violation of probation or parole for purposes of CalFresh eligibility if an impartial party, such as a judge or officially sanctioned tribunal, had determined that the individual violated a condition of his or her probation or parole imposed under federal or state law. [Id.]  In addition, to be disqualified from CalFresh, the federal, state, or local law enforcement authorities must be actively seeking the individual to enforce the conditions of the probation or parole. [Id.]  Counties must get verification of probation or parole violator
status and must verify that law enforcement is actively seeking the individual.  [Id.]
Sexual assault or murder convictions
Persons who have been convicted as an adult of one of the following offenses after February 7, 2014 are ineligible for CalFresh:
   * Aggrevated sexual abuse under 18 U.S.C. section 2241;
   * Murder under section 18 U.S.C. section 1111;
   * An offense under 18 U.S.C chapter 110;
   * A Federal or State offense involving sexual assault, as defined in section 40002(a) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13925(a)); or
   * An offense under State law determined by the Attorney General to be substantially similar to an offense described above.

alFresh E&T Handbook 2022  6 | PageINTRODUCTION 
In accordance with the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, each state must offer a 
Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance Program  (SNAP)  Employment  and Training  (E&T) 
program .  In California, the program is called  CalFresh E&T.  
The purpose of the CalFresh E&T program is to increase the employment and earning 
capacity of CalFresh recipients by providing participants with the support needed to 
obtain skills and credentialing.   CalFresh E&T provides participants with case 
management  services and access to basic  education,  work  experience,  training,  and job 
search assistance, as well as supportive services to assist with expenses related to finding and retaining work.  
CalFresh E&T has five strategic  goals:  
1. Increase job placement,  retention,  and wages ;
2. Increase CalFresh E&T participation across  a dynamic  mix of people, communities
and cultures ;
3. Increase employability  by removing barriers  to employment ;
4. Increase skills  attainment  and credentialing ; and
5. Lead an efficient  and effective  customer focused CalFresh  E&T program.
PART I:  PROGRAM MODEL  
The United  States  Department  of Agriculture  (USDA) , Food and Nutrition  Service  (FNS) 
is the  entity responsible for  federal oversight of SNAP and E&T services.  T he California 
Department of Social Services (CDSS) is the entity responsible for state oversight of 
CalFresh and E&T services , which are administered locally through County Welfare 
Departments (CWDs).   The CWDs are not mandated to offer a CalFresh E&T program 
but may choose to do so voluntarily.   Tribal organizations may also choose to offer a 
CalFresh E&T program.  
The CWDs  and tribal  organizations  have the autonomy  to design programs  around 
CalFresh E&T components and activities, population characteristics, in- demand 
occupations, service providers , and available funding sources.   Services may be 
provided directly by the CWD or tribal  organization,  or through partner  entities  in which 
they have an agreement .  
The CDSS also enters into agreements with partner entities, known as state partners, to provide targeted CalFresh  E&T services  throughout  the state  with coordination and 
approval of the CWDs and tribal organizations.     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   7 | Page 
 ANNUAL  PLAN 
The CDSS is required to submit  the CalFresh E&T Annual  Plan to the FNS by August  
15 of each calendar year.   The CDSS receives the authority and funding to administer 
the CalFresh E&T program upon approval of the CDSS CalFresh E&T Annual Plan by 
the FNS, as outlined in Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 
273.7(c)(8) .  The CDSS CalFresh E&T Annual Plan is considered a legal agreement 
between the CDSS and the FNS.  
The CalFresh E&T Annual Plan is comprised of all locally administered and state 
partner  plans.   All plans  must  include the program components  to be offered, detailed 
estimations  of participant counts,  and associated administrative and supportive service 
costs.   All entities responsible for the administration of the CalFresh E&T program must 
submit an Annual Plan to the CDSS in order to secure funds for the following Federal 
Fiscal Year (FFY).  
After approval of the CDSS CalFresh E&T Annual  Plan, all program changes must be 
submitted via an amendment to alter program components, add/remove partnerships, 
amend budgets, or request additional funds.  All entities responsible for the adminis tration of CalFresh E&T must submit  plan amendments to the CDSS 60 days 
prior to implementation, and before May 31 of each calendar year to be considered.   
CONSULTATION  WITH  LOCAL  WORKFORCE  DEVELOPMENT 
BOARD S 
CWDs  are required to design their CalFresh E&T programs  in consultation with Local 
Workforce Development Boards (LWBDs), as described in All County Letter (ACL) No. 
21-48.  CWDs have the flexibility to consult with private employers or employer 
organizations in lieu of LWDBs, if they can demonstrate it is more effective or efficient, per 7 CFR 273.7(c)(5) .  Tribal organizations and state partners should also design their 
CalFresh E&T programs in consultation with the LWDB s.  
CWDs are encouraged to partner with the LWDBs, community -based organizations 
(CBOs), adult  education centers,  employers,  and other  existing  workforce  providers  to 
leverage resources, braid funding, and respond to community needs with access to 
quality training and supportive services.   The CalFresh E&T  program  aligns with the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) to increase coordination between 
CalFresh E&T and other workforce development programs within the state.   CWDs 
must include in their Annual Plan submission the extent to which CalFresh E&T 
activities will be carried out in coordination with the activities under WIOA.  
     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   8 | Page 
 ELIGIBILITY  AND  ENROLLMENT 
Enrollment and participation in the CalFresh E&T program are voluntary for eligible 
CalFresh recipients .  CalFresh recipients are not required to enroll in the CalFresh E&T 
program  to keep their CalFresh benefits,  and participants  cannot  have their CalFresh 
benefits sanctioned for failure to participate.   All entities providing CalFresh E&T 
services are responsible for confirmation of a participant’s  eligibility each month.   
CalFresh E&T participants  must  be: 
• A t least 16 years of age ( Note:  A person aged 16 or 17 who is not the head of 
household,  or who is attending school,  or enrolled in an employment  and training 
program on at least a half -time basis cannot participat e); 
• In receipt of federally funded CalFresh food assistance benefits; and  
• Not subject to any work requirement under Title IV of the Social Security Act, 
such as through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, 
known in California as the California Work Opportunity Responsibility to Kids 
(CalWORKs) program .   
Targe t Populations  
The CalFresh  E&T program  serves  diverse populations  whose characteristics may differ 
between counties.   All entities responsible for the administration of services are 
encouraged to design their programs to meet the needs of their local populations and economies.  Some  examples  of target  populations  are: 
• Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) ; 
• English  language learners  (ELL)/those who speak  English  as a second language 
(ESL) ; 
• Formerly  incarcerated;  
• General  Assistance/General  Relief  (GA/GR)  participants/recipients ;  
• Homeless  individuals  and families ; 
• Students ; and  
• Timed- out CalWORKs  participants . 
CERTIFICATION  AND  SCREENING  
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(c) , the CWDs are responsible for the following during 
the certification of CalFresh benefits : 
• Registering eac h non- exempt household member for work ; 
• Screening for ABAWD exemptions ; 
• Providing written and oral notification, of the CalFresh work rules , to all CalFresh 
recipients as described in ACL No. 22-74;    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   9 | Page 
 • Notifying individuals of available employment services ; 
• R eferring CalFresh recipients  to appropriate workforce partnerships ; and 
• Referr ing appropriate individuals  to CalFresh E&T , if available .  
Work  Registration 
The CWDs assume responsibility for the work registration process.  As part of the initial  
application and recertification interview, the CWDs must determine which individuals in 
the household are work registrants.   This information must be noted in the case record.  
In accordance with ACL No. 20- 10 and 7 CFR 273.7(b)(1) , all CalFresh recipients  are 
subject to work registration unless they qualify for an exemption.   Individuals  are exempt  
from work  registration if they are: 
• Under 16 or over 59 years of age ( A person aged 16 or 17 who is not the head of 
household,  or who is attending school,  or enrolled in an employment  and training 
program on at least a half -time basis is also exempt);  
• Physically  or mentally  unfit for employment ; 
• Subject  to and complying with any work  requirement  under  Title IV of the Social 
Security Act, including CalWORKs ; 
• A parent  of, or responsible for the care of, a dependent  child under  age six  (The 
child does not have to be a CalFresh recipient or living in the home) ; 
• Responsible for the care of an incapacitated person (T he incapacitated person 
does  not have to be a CalFresh recipient  or living  in the home) ; 
• Receiving,  or have applied for, unemployment  insurance benefits ; 
• A regular  participant  in a drug or alcohol  treatment  and rehabilitation program ; 
• Employed or self -employed at least 30- hours per week or receiving weekly 
earnings  at least  equal  to the federal  minimum  wage multiplied  by 30-hours ; or 
• Enrolled in a school,  training program  or institution of higher  education on at least 
a half time basis . 
Regulations at 7 CFR 273.7(a)  establish the following requirements for work registrants.  
All work registrants must:  
• Register  for work  or be registered by the CWD at the time of application and 
every 12- months thereafter ; 
• Participa te in mandatory E&T, if assigned by the CWD (CalFresh E&T is a 
voluntary program in all participating CWDs) ; 
• Provide  enough information to determine employment  status  or availability  for 
work; 
• Report  to an employer  when referred by the CWD or its designee;  
• Accept  a bona fide offer of suitable employment ; and 
• Not voluntarily quit a job of 30 or more hours a week or reduce work hours to    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   10 | Page 
 fewer  than 30-hours  a  week  in accordance with regulations  as defined in  7 CFR 
273.7(j) . 
Able -Bodied Adults  Without  Dependents  
An ABAWD, as defined  in 7 CFR 273.24, is a CalFresh recipient, age 18 through 49, 
who is able -bodied without dependent children and does not  meet the criteria  for an 
exemption from the  ABAWD time limit.  ABAWD eligibility  for CalFresh is time- limited to  
any three full months of  benefits in a 36-month period unless the individual:  
• Satisfies  the ABAWD work  requirement  (CalFresh E&T components may satisfy 
the ABAWD hourly requirement, but enrollment of ABAWDs into CalFresh E&T 
remains voluntary) ; 
• Is exempt  from the  ABAWD time limit; 
• Qualifies  for an additional  three consecutive month period of eligibility ; or 
• Lives  in a county  or area with an ABAWD time limit waiver . 
More  detailed information about ABAWD policy is in the ABAWD Handbook 2.0 as 
published in ACL No. 19 -93. 
PARTICIPANT REFERRAL  
Individuals who have been certified for CalFresh benefits and screened for work registration and ABAWD exemptions  may participate in the CalFresh E&T program  
upon referral by the CWD.  In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(c)( 2), the CWD is  
responsible for determining whether it is appropriate, based on the CWD ’s criteria, to 
refer the individual to CalFresh E&T.  
Criteria for Referral  
The CDSS criteria for referral to the CalFresh E&T program  is inclusive of all CalFresh 
applicants and recipi ents whom are interested in services.  T he CDSS referral criteria 
include s, but is not limited to, work  registrants and non- work registrants, recent work 
history, individuals proficient in English, English -language learners, i ndividual interest in 
programs offered, access to technology if program related, and participant 
reimbursement needs.   
The CWD has the flexibility and responsibility to develop CWD criteria to determine who will be referred to the CalFresh E&T program.  The CDSS encourages CWDs to consider the following when developing their  criteria for referral:   
• A vailability of participant reimbursements ;   
• C riteria for participation in the activities offered; 
• Accessibility of services where participants live; and  
• Participant needs and preferences.    CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022  11 | PageDirect Referral  
The CWD eligibility worker  is responsible for the referral of CalFresh applicants and/or 
recipients to the CalFresh E&T program  after screening for work registration and 
appropriateness for participation.  The referral takes place during the certification 
process, at either application or recertification.  As part of the referral process, the 
eligibility worker must  provide information about the next steps for accessing the 
CalFresh E&T program .  The CWD eligibility worker  must be familiar with services 
offered by the CalFresh E&T program to ensure appropriateness of the referral.  
Reverse Referral  
If an individual has not been screened and referred to the CalFresh E&T program  by the 
CWD during the certification process , but subsequently learns about a CalFresh E&T 
provider program on their own, the provider may ask the CWD to screen and refer the 
individual to that specific program.  The CWD remains responsible for determination of 
CalFresh benefit eligibility, work registration status , ABAWD exemption s, and 
appropriateness  for referral to the CalFresh E&T program as required by  7 CFR 
273.7(c)(2) .   
CalFresh  Confirm Tool 
The CalFresh  Confirm  tool allows  CalFresh E&T providers  to confirm  CalFresh E&T 
eligibility for the current and previous 12 months .  To streamline administrative 
responsibilities, the CalFresh Confirm tool provides an alternative method to screen for 
initial and ongoing eligibility  in accordance with 7 CFR  273.7(c)(2) .  CalFresh E&T 
eligibility must be confirmed for each month of participation for reporting and invoicing 
purposes .  More  information regarding the CalFresh Confirm  tool is located in the All 
County Welfare Directors Letter (ACWDL) July 14, 2021. 
CASE  MANAGEMENT  
In addition to providing at least one component, all CalFresh E&T programs  must  
provide case management  services , as described in 7 CFR 273.7(e)(1) .  The purpose of 
case management services is to guide a participant toward appropriate components  
and activities  based on the participant’s  needs  and interests,  support  the participant in 
the program, and provide activities and resources that help the participant achieve 
program goals .  Case management may include comprehensive intake as sessments, 
employability assessments, individualized service plans, progress monitoring, and coordination with service providers.      
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   12 | Page 
 Comprehensive  Intake Assessment 
A comprehensive intake  assessment  is the initial meeting with the participant  during 
which the case manager gathers information to address the participant’s immediate 
needs to encourage engagement in CalFresh E&T services .  This includes collecting 
and evaluating information to identify  a participant’s employment  capabilities, inter ests, 
barriers, and supportive service needs.  
Employability  Assessment 
An employability  assessment  examines an individual's  readiness  for employment ; 
assesses  skills such as applied academic skills, interpersonal skills, critical thinking 
skills, and  communication skills ; identif ies barriers to work ; and highlight s past work 
experience .  Job skills assessments, which determine whether an individual has the 
skills appropriate for a specific  job, may be included in the employability  assessment.  
Individualized  Service Plan 
An individualized service plan is developed jointly by the participant and CalFresh E&T 
provider as an ongoing strategy to identify  employment  goals,  achievement  objectives,  
and an appropriate combination of services for the participant to achieve their education 
and/or employment goals.  
Progress  Monitoring  
Progress  monitoring includes  tracking participant  progress  in the form of, at minimum, 
monthly case notes.   CalFresh E&T providers must track participant activities and 
supportive service delivery in order to ensure appropriate services are provided to eligible participants.   
Coordination  with Service Providers 
Coordination amongst  service providers is intended to help participants locate, access , 
and coordinate a network of supports and services that will help them to succeed.   
Service coordination includes assistance to participants in planning, developing, 
choosing, gaining access to, coordinating, and monitoring the provision of needed 
services and supports .  Service coordination responsibilities include, but are not limited 
to, developing, implementing and monitoring the participant ; establishing and 
maintaining a case record; and providing general oversight of services and supports .  
Entities administering the CalFres h E&T program that  refer or co -enroll participants with 
multiple service p roviders  should ensure providers do not provide duplicate services.  
     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   13 | Page 
 COMPONENTS  AND ACTIVITIES 
A CalFresh E&T component is defined as a service, activity, or program designed to 
help CalFresh recipients  gain skills, training,  or work  experience.   Multiple  activities  may 
exist under each component .  One or more components may be offered based on 
regional need, capacity,  and funding availability .  A participant  may enroll in multiple 
components simultaneously or in sequence, when available.   In accordance with 7 CFR 
273.7(c)(11)(iii) , an individual is  considered a CalFresh E&T participant upon attending  
at least one part  of the program , including an orientation, assessment, case 
management, or a component.  
Orientation and assessment  are CalFresh E&T activities  that inform  participants  about 
available services .  Individuals who attend orientation and/or assessment must be 
tracked to meet federal and state reporting requirements.   Orientation and/or 
assessment are typically the first activities participants engage in prior  to starting  a 
component.   Of note,  orientation and assessment  are initial participation activities, not  
components.  
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(e)(2) , all components must require a certain level of 
effort by participants.  The level of effort should be comparable to spending 
approximately  12 hours  per month for two months  making job contacts  (less in workfare 
or work experience components if the household's benefit divided by the minimum wage is less than this amount).  
CalFresh E&T components  include:  
• Education;  
• Job Retention;  
• Self-Employment  Training (SET) ; 
• Supervised Job Search;  
• Work Experience; and  
• Workfare.  
Education 
The education component  includes  a wide range of activities  that improve basic  skills, 
literacy, and employability.   All education activities must have a direct link to 
employment and help participants move promptly into employment, as specified in 7 
CFR 273.7(e)(2)(vi) .  Allowable  education program components  include,  but are not 
limited  to: 
• Adult Basic Education (ABE)  and/or Foundational  Skills Instruction ; 
• Career  and Technical  Education (CTE)  and/or Vocational  Training;     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   14 | Page 
 • English  Language Acquisition  (ELA) ; 
• Integrated Education and Training (IET)  or Bridge Programs ; and  
• Work  Readiness  Training (WRT) .  
Adult Basic Education and/or Foundation al Skills Instruction  
ABE programs serve adults working toward a High School Diploma (HSD),  a General  
Education Diploma  (GED), and/or  improving basic  literacy skills.   Foundational skills 
instruction improves basic literacy, numeracy, and transferrable skills .  
Career and Technical  Education  and/or Vocational  Training  
Allowable  educational  programs  or activities  under  a CTE and/or Vocational Training 
program may include, but are not limited to, courses or programs of study that are part 
of a program of career and technical education as defined in Section 3 of the Carl D. 
Perkins Act of 2006.    
English  Language  Acquisition  
In accordance with 34 CFR 463.31, the ELA component must be : 
• D esigned to help eligible individuals who are English language learners achieve 
competence in reading, writing,  speaking,  and comprehension of the English 
language; and 
• Leads  to attainment  of a secondary  school  diploma or its recognized equivalent; 
and transition to postsecondary education and training; or employment . 
Examples  of ELA include, but are not limited  to ESL, ELL and vocational  English  as a 
second language.  
Integrated Education and Training  or Bridge Programs  
The IET component combines occupational  skills  training and basic  academic  skills  
instruction to increase and expedite the educational and career advancement of 
participants .  As described in 34 CFR 463.35, IET is a service approach that  provides  
adult education and literacy  activities  concurrently  and contextually  with workforce 
preparation activities and training for a specific occupation or occupational cluster for the purpose of educational and career advancement.  
Bridge programs  prepare adults to enroll in postsecondary education and training and 
provide a combination of academic and occupational instruction, career guidance, and 
support services .  These programs  combine basic skill instruction in reading, math, 
writing, English language,  and GED test  preparation with occupational content, 
employment skills, and college success strategies.     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   15 | Page 
 Work  Readiness  Training  
The WRT  component  includes  educational  programs  or activities  designed to improve 
basic skills, build work readiness, or otherwise improve employability and includes 
educational programs determined to expand the job search abilities or employability of participants .  WRT can include instruction of topics such as general skills building, 
developing good work habits, and building a work history .  Work readiness skills are 
often referred to as soft skills.  
Job Retention 
The job retention component provides case management and supportive services to participants  for a minimum of 30 days  and a maximum of  90 days  after employment  is 
secured.   As described in 7 CFR 273.7(e)(2)(viii) , the start date for job retention 
services may be determined utilizing the date hired provided that the individual received 
CalFresh benefits  in the month of or the month prior to beginning job retention services .  
Only individuals who received employment and training services under another 
qualifying CalFresh E&T component prior to obtaining new or improved employment are 
eligible for job retention services .  Supportive services may include assistance with 
transportation, childcare, or ancillary items such as uniforms and tools.  
Self-Employment  Training  
The SET component  improves  participant employability  by providing training in opening 
and operating a small business or other self -employment venture.   SET is an option for 
workers in many career fields and industries .  It can help participants start, advance, or 
enhance their career.   Self -employment options include but are not limited to : 
• Gig employment,  defined as a single  project  or task for which  a worker  is hired, 
often through a digital marketplace, to work on demand ; 
• Freelance work, which is often used to apply to more skilled and long- term 
projects .  Freelancers apply their skills or talent on a pay -for-service basis, 
outside of a regular employer -employee relationship.   Examples of freelance 
work  may include web design,  writing,  repair  services, landscaping,  accounting, 
photography, or personal fitness coaching; and 
• Starting  a business  with a physical location  and/or  employing others  to make or 
sell goods or provide services .  
Supervised  Job Search  
As defined in 7 CFR 273.7(e)(2)(i) , supervised job search must  occur  at approved 
locations where the activities of participants are directly supervised and tracked.  
Approved locations include any location deemed suitable by the entity responsible for    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   16 | Page 
 the administration of the CalFresh  E&T program  where the participant  has access  to the 
tools and materials  needed to perform supervised job search.   Tools used in the 
supervised job search program may include virtual tools, such as websites, portals, or 
web applications .  Entities responsible for administ ering the CalFresh E&T program are 
encouraged to offer a variety of locations and formats to best meet participant needs 
and, to the extent practicable, allow participants to choose their preferred location.  
Supervision can occur separately with respect to the participant's job search activities, but must be provided by skilled staff, either remotely or in- person, who provide 
meaningful  guidance and support  with at least  monthly  check -ins.  Supervision  must  be 
provided in a manner that  best support s the participant . 
Supervised job search activities must demonstrate a direct link to increasing the employment opportunities of individuals engaged in the activity .  Job search that does 
not meet the definition of supervised job search is allowed as a subsidiary activity of another  component,  if the job search activity  comprises  less than half of the total time 
spent in the component.  
All entities responsible for administration of the CalFresh E&T  program  may establish a 
supervised job search period that will provide  participants  a reasonable opportunity  to 
find suitable employment .  However, they should not  establish a continuous, year -round 
supervised job search component .  If a reasonable period of supervised job search 
does not result in employment, placing the individual in a training or education component to improve job skills will likely be more productive.   Individuals may 
participate in supervised job search from the time a CalFresh application is filed.  
In accordance with the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and 7 CFR 273.24,  a supervised 
job search program is not a qualifying activity relating to the participation requirements 
necessary to maintain CalFresh eligibility for ABAWDs .  However, a job search 
program, supervised or otherwise, when operated under Title I of the WIOA, under 
section 236 of the Trade Act, or a program of employment and training for veterans operated by the Department of Labor (DOL) or the Department of Veterans Affairs, is considered a qualifying activity relating to the participation requirements necessary to maintain CalFresh eligibility for ABAWDs.   Services  and activities  under  this component  
may include,  but are not limite d to: 
• Job search training;  
• Master application;  
• Mock  interviews ; and  
• Resume development . 
Workfare  
Participants may work off the value of their household’s monthly CalFresh benefit    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   17 | Page 
 allotment through a workfare assignment at a public or private non -profit organization.  
Participants cannot complete workfare at for -profit organizations or employers . 
Participants in this component gain valuable work experience and increase 
employability by participating in a variety of workfare activities .  In lieu of wages, 
workfare participants receive compensation in the form of their household’s monthly 
CalFresh benefit  allotment.  
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(m)(5)(ii) , the maximum number of hours of work each 
month must be determined using the following formula:

In accor
dance with 7 CFR 273.7(e)(5)(iii) , voluntary participants are not subject  to 
hourly restrictions, as long as they are paid a wage for all hours spent in workfare  at a 
rate at least equal to the local, state, or federal minimum wage, whichever is highest.  
Work  Experience 
The work  experience component  is designed to improve the e mployability  of 
participants through actual work experience or training, or both, and to enable individuals employed or trained under such programs to move promptly into regular 
public or private employment.   Work experience is defined as a planned, structured 
learning experience that takes place in a workplace for a limited period.  
Work  experience may be paid or unpaid,  as appropriate  and consistent  with other  laws.  
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(m)(5)(ii) , a participant’s unpaid work experience hours 
must not exceed the household’s CalFresh monthly allotment divided by the local, state 
or federal minimum wage, whichever is highest .  In accordance with 7 CFR 
273.7(e)(5)(iii) , voluntary participant s are not subject  hourly restrictions , as long as they  
are paid a wage for all hours spent in a CalFresh  E&T work program  at a rate at least 
equal to the local, state or federal minimum wage, whichever is highest.   The work  
experience  component  may include a work activity or a work -based learning program, 
as described below.  
Work Activity 
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(e)(2)(iv)(A)(1) , work activit ies may be performed in 
exchange for CalFresh benefits  that provide the participant with an opportunity to 
acquire the general skills, knowledge, and work habits necessary to obtain employment .  
The purpose of work activity is to improve the employability of those who cannot find    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   18 | Page

Work -Based  Learning  
Work-based learning activities are sustained interactions with industry or  community 
professionals in real world settings to the extent practicable, or simulated environments 
at an educational institution that fosters in- depth, firsthand engagement with the tasks 
required in a given career field, that are aligned to curriculum and instruction.  Work -
based learning emphasizes employer engagement, includes specific training objectives, 
and leads to regular employment.  Allowable  activities  under  this component  include 
apprenticeships/pre- apprenticeships, c ustomized t raining, i nternships, on-the-job training 
(OJT), and transitional jobs.  Work -based learning activities may be subsidized or 
unsubsidized.     
Work -based learning activities must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and all 
other applicable labor laws in accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(e)(2)(iv) .  Labor standards 
apply in any work experience setting where an employee/employer relationship exists .  
Labor standards include but are not limited to:  
• Participants must receive the same benefits and working conditions as non-
CalFresh E&T participants doing comparable work for comparable hours 
including holidays, sick pay, vacation, and medical insurance;  
• The employer or CalFresh E&T provider must provide worker’s compensation 
coverage; 
• Participants must be paid the same amount as other comparable workers ; 
• Participants must be paid a wage at least equal to the local, state or federal 
minimum wage, whichever is highest ; 
• Participants must not displace or replace existing employment of individuals not participating in CalFresh E&T;  
• An employer is not permitted to lay off workers or fill openings that were previously held by unsubsidized workers and replace them with subsidized work -
based learning ( SWBL ) participants ; and  
• SWBL participants must not be used to cross strike lines as this would have the effect of replacing existing workers . 
Further guidance regarding work -based learning activities , including wage sub sidies,  
time limits , and allowable expenses , is in ACL No. 22 -38.    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   19 | Page 
 Apprenticeships  
Apprent iceships, as defined by the United States DOL, are industry -driven, high quality 
career pathways where employers can develop and prepare their future workforce, and 
individuals can obtain paid work experience, classroom instruction, and a portable, nationa lly recognized credential.   More information about apprenticeships can be found 
on the DOL’s dedicated apprenticeship, website .    
Customized Training  
Customized training may be performed at any private or public employer with which the 
CalFresh E&T provider  has entered an acceptable agreement .  Employers must provide 
actual training and a plan to move participants into unsubsidized employment as a 
result of the experience.   Customized training is one type of work -based learning that can 
be used to target  specific  job seeker and employer needs .  It is an effective strategy that 
provides additional opportunities for participants and employers in both finding quality 
work and developing a quality workforce.  
As defined in the 20 CFR 618.110, customized training is designed to meet the specific 
requirements of an employer (including a group of employers); is conducted with a commitment by the employer  to employ  an individual  upon successful completion of the 
training; and requires that the employer pay a significant portion (but no less than 50 
percent ) of the cost of such training.  
Internships  
An internship is a professional  learning experience that offers  meaningful,  practical  work 
related to an individual’s field of study or career interest .  An internship gives the 
participant the opportunity for career exploration and development, and to learn new skills.  
On-The-Job Training  
OJT is a strategic  employment  service that supports  the business community in the 
hiring process by adding staff capacity, productivity and training at reduced costs to the employer .  OJT is a way for participants to build skills  and re-establish employment  
status .  OJT benefits  employers  by reducing the cost of training new employees .  The 
employer designs the on- site training, which is aligned with the skills required for the job 
and is a long- term investment in the company .  OJT benefits  participants  by providing 
an opportunity  to “earn as they learn”  in a hands -on environment, acquire job and career 
advancement skills, and by providing opportunities for long- term employment. 
The purpose of OJT is to encourage public, private non- profit, or private employers to 
hire an individual or upgrade an eligible employed worker who would not otherwise    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   20 | Page 
 qualify  for the job, and to teach the skills  requisite  to perform  the job.  CalFresh E&T 
funds can used to reimburse the employer for the training period in exchange for the 
commitment by the employer to retain the participant, upon successful completion.  
As described in 20 CFR 680.720, the OJT employer may receive reimbursement for 
allowable training costs  up to 50 percent of the OJT participant’s wage rate.   In rare 
circumstances , in accordance with 20 CFR  680.730, the employer  can be reimbursed, 
for up to 75 percent of the OJT participant’s wage rate due to the employer’s 
extraordinary costs of providing training and additional supervision.   In accordance with 
20 CFR 680.730(b) , CalFresh E&T providers  must  document  the factors  used when 
deciding to increase the wage reimbursement levels above 50 percent .  
Pre-Apprenticeships  
A pre -apprenticeship is a program or set of strategies designed to prepare individuals to 
enter and succeed in an Industry -Recognized Apprenticeship Program (IRAP).  An 
IRAP is a proven model of apprenticeship that has been validated by the DOL or a State 
Apprenticeship Agency.  Pre- apprenticeship programs should have a documented 
partnership with at least one IRAP.   
Transitional  Jobs  
Transitional jobs , in accordance with 20 CFR 680.190, provide a time- limited work 
experience in the public, private, or non- profit  sectors  that is paid and subsidized for 
individuals  with barriers  to employment  who are chronically unemployed or have 
inconsistent work history .  Transitional jobs are designed to enable an individual  to 
establish a work  history,  demonstrate work  success, and develop skills that lead to 
unsubsidized employment.  
Transitional jobs provide individuals with paid work experience and an opportunity to develop important workplace skills within the context of an employee- employer 
relationship, in which the program provider generally acts as the employer, and with an 
opportunity  to develop important  workplace skills .  Unlike  OJT, with transitional jobs the 
training provider may be the employer of record and there is no requirement that the 
employer retains the individual upon completion of the transitional job; h owever, job 
retention is an ideal outcome.    
Target populations include:  
• Long- term unemployed  individuals ; 
• Formerly incarcerated individuals ; and  
• Individuals  with disabilities .     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   21 | Page 
 PART II:  PARTNERSHIPS 
Entities responsible for administering the CalFresh E&T program may choose to 
incorporate partner services .  Partnerships can increase the capacity of a program to 
serve eligible individuals by leveraging funding, culturally  competent engagement, and 
workforce development expertise.   Strategic  use of partnerships can boost service 
access and capacity, enhance service delivery, and serve broader populations.   Partner  
entities  typically  include:  
• Community  and technical  colleges ; 
• Employers ; 
• LWDBs;  
• Non-profit  and CBOs ; 
• Social enterprises ; and  
• WIOA service providers . 
Entities responsible for the administration of the CalFresh E&T program who engage in 
partnerships for the delivery of CalFresh E&T services to participants must enter into a 
formal agreement , such as memoranda of understanding (MOU ) or subrecipient 
agreement .   
The CWDs may dedicate their allocated 100 percent funds for the provision of the 
partner ’s services and /or seek 50 percent reimbursement for eligible costs.   Due to 
funding limitations , many CWDs  enter  partnerships with entities who agree to provide 
CalFresh E&T program services to participants  using their own non-f ederal funding (e.g. 
grants, revenue, or philanthropic donations) .  The CWDs  then submit these 
expenditures for reimbursement to the CDSS as their own.  The CDSS reimburses the 
CWD, who then pass reimbursement on to their  partner .  The CDSS  has historically 
referenced partnerships funded this way as “third- party partnerships.”   
Partner  services may include administration  of components  and case management.   
Other  responsibilities  may include  essential  program  activities  such as orientation, 
assessment, issuance of supportive services to participants, participant tracking, and 
any other mutually agreed upon responsibilities.    
INTERMEDIARY  
An intermediary can provide support to entities responsible for the administration of the 
CalFresh E&T p rogram  by centralizing and performing several  required and essential 
administrative tasks.  Intermediar ies increase capacity and support the CalFresh E&T 
program by leveraging established leadership roles, key partnerships, and expertise 
within the workforce and employment and training arena.   Intermediaries may not 
perform certification tasks such as  screening  for work registration exemptions and    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   22 | Page 
 issuing CalFresh notices .  
The CWD remains responsible for the administration of the CalFresh E&T program and 
must be significantly involved in monitoring the work of the intermediary.  W hen 
choosing an intermediary, the CWD  should consider that an effective  intermediary 
needs strong knowledge of CalFresh E&T policy, federal funding, and  the local 
workforce development system.  The CWD  should establish clear roles, 
responsibilities, and levels of authority with an intermediary to ensure programs are 
well-managed.  
TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS 
The CDSS may enter  into agreement s with tribal organiz ations to administer the 
CalFresh E&T program .    
The CDSS is responsible for  administrative and fiscal oversight of the CalFresh E&T 
program operated by the tribal organization, including  the payment for eligible expenses 
directly to the tribal organizati on.  A tribal organization administering the CalFresh E&T 
program  must : 
• Complete a CalFresh E&T Annual  Plan; 
• Follow all federal  and state  rules  and regulations  pertaining to CalFresh E&T  
including federal fiscal guidelines as defined in 2 CFR Part 200- Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards ; 
• Submit  invoices  directly  to the CDSS for reimbursement  of allowable  CalFresh 
E&T expenditures; and 
• Comply  with federal  and state data reporting requirements.  
STATE PARTNERS 
Entities that hold a direct subrecipient agreement with the CDSS to administer the CalFresh E&T program are known as state partners.  
State partners can provide CalFresh E&T services to participants that reside in counties 
with which they have a formal agreement, such as an MOU.  State partners must 
include language in their agreements with the CWDs to share relevant CalFresh E&T 
participant data to verify participant eligibility and complete required federal and state 
reporting.  In addition, state partners and CWDs must mutually agree to the CalFresh E&T services provided and outline those services in their respective Annual Plans.  
The CDSS is responsible for the administrative and fiscal oversight of the CalFresh E&T 
program operated by the state partner.  This includes the payment for eligible expenses directly to the state partner.  A state partner must :    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   23 | Page 
 • Complete a CalFresh E&T Annual  Plan; 
• Follow all federal  and state  rules  and regulations  pertaining to CalFresh E&T 
including federal fiscal guidelines as defined in 2 CFR Part 200- Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards ; 
• Submit  invoices  directly  to the CDSS for reimbursement  of allowable  CalFresh 
E&T exp enditures ; and 
• Comply  with federal, state and county data reporting requirements.  
PARTNER CONSIDERATIONS 
When evaluating whether to work with potential partners, entities administrating the 
CalFresh E&T program should obtain enough information to determine whether the 
potential partner:  
• Serves one or more CalFresh E&T target population(s) ; 
• Provides allowable services under CalFresh E&T; and  
• Provides a program with objectives that align  with the goals of the CalFresh E&T 
program.  
CalFresh E&T goals include  increased:  
• P articipation ;  
• Job placement, retention, and living wages ; and 
• E mployability of participants through skills attainment and credentialing via 
effective  and customer focused program  design.  
An ideal partner program:  
• Works to help participants reach economic independence through employment and training strategies/supportive services ; 
• Is “job -driven,” responsive to employer demand, places ready -to-work 
participants in good, available jobs, and/or provides skills training and credentials to help participants obtain employment ; 
• Connects participants with  supportive services to facilitate  program success ; 
• Effectively assesses participants to ensure program fit ; and  
• Tailors services to meet individual needs and goals.  
Partner Assessment  
Partner assessments seek the detailed information needed to determine whether potential providers could be effective CalFresh E&T partners.  Information such as outcomes, staffing capacity, non- federal revenue sources available for reimbursement,    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   24 | Page 
 fiscal an d contract compliance capacity should be evaluated.  
Some useful questions for determining service capacity may include:  
• Does the partner currently  offer activities that are appropriate and allowable 
under the CalFresh E&T program , or will it have to create new activities for 
participants? 
• Does the partner already serve an identified CalFresh E&T target population?  
• Does the partner have the capacity to verify participant eligibility monthly ? 
• Can the partner assess and place participants in appropriate CalFresh E&T 
activities?  
• What supportive services can the partner provide?  
• Can the partner monitor and report on participant  progress ? 
Some useful questions for determining financial capacity may include:  
• Does the partner have the cash- flow to support the CalFresh E&T program? 
• Will the partner be able to handle potential delays between expenditures paid 
and receiving reimbursement? 
• Does the partner have federal grant experience? 
• Will the partner be able to track federal funds and guarantee allowable non-
federal funding sources ? 
• Does the partner already allocate costs to other federal, state or local grants? 
• Does the cost allocation plan charge grants in a consistent manner? 
• Does the partner have the capacity to track staff time and resources  spent on the 
CalFresh E&T program  versus other programs in which it may participate?  
• Can the partner store documents /records for the CDSS audits and reviews?  
Agreement s 
Formal agreement s must be in place between entities responsible for the administration 
of the CalFresh E&T program and their partners.  These agreement s must include a ll 
relevant responsibilities of partners providing services and must be included  in the 
Annual Plan.  Agreements  with partners should include the following key elements:  
• Detailed description of services provided;  
• Target population and anticipated number of participants to be served for each 
CalFresh E&T activity provided;  
• Outcome data tracking, including the number of participants expected to 
complete each activity and the number that become employed;  
• Budget and budget narrative that includes costs and funding sources ; and 
• Compliance with 2 CFR 200- Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost 
Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards .    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   25 | Page 
 Best Practices  
Partnerships can facilitate CalFresh E&T program growth by extending services to more 
eligible individuals.  O utcomes can be improved by tapping into existing high- quality 
providers within the community.  Best practices for maintaining strong partnerships 
include:  
• Thoughtful onboarding that may include orientation activities to review program administration, or a partner handbook for reference throughout the partnership; 
• Streamlined referral processes to increase participant enrollment and track outcomes ; and  
• Regular communication with partners about program goals, efficiencies, and problem resolution.  
PROVIDER DETERMINATION  
As outlined in ACL No. 21 -48, a provider determination is a decision by a CalFresh E&T 
partner  entity that a participant is not a good fit (i.e. , is ill-suited) for a component.  This 
may occur if the assigned component or activity does not meet a participant’s individual needs and/or skill level, or if a participant otherwise fails to benefit from the program.  A provider determination can be made from the time a participant is referred to the 
component until completion.   The partner entity must  notify the CWD of the provider 
determination as well the reason for the determination within ten (10) days  of the 
decision.  
Upon receipt of the provider determination , the CWD is required to determine whether  
the individual should continue to participate in CalFresh E&T.  If the partner entity  offers 
another, more suitable component, the CWD has the option to either:  
• Require the partner  entity  to refer the i ndividual back to the CWD before 
switching the individual to the other component; or  
• Allow the partner  entity  to shift the individual to the other component without 
referral back to the CWD.  
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(c)(18)(i)(A) , once the CWD receives a provider 
determination, and the CalFresh E&T participant  is not exempt from the work 
requirement, the CWD must:  
• Notify the CalFresh E&T participant of the provider determination within ten (10) 
days of receipt ; 
• E xplain to the participant  in writing or verbally what a provider determination is, 
how to contact the CWD, and the next steps the CWD is taking ; 
• N otify the participant that they are not being sanctioned as a result of the    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   26 | Page 
 provider determination;   and  
• N otify the individual if they are an ABAWD, subject to the time limit, that they will 
begin to accrue countable months the next full benefit month following the month 
the provider determination is made, unless the ABAWD satisfies the work 
requirement, has good cause, lives in a waived area, or is otherwise exempt.  
Once a provider notification has been received, the CWD must select one of the following four options no later than the participant’s next recertification, as required by   
7 CFR 273.7(c)(18)(i)(B) : 
1. Refer the individual to another appropriate component.  
2. Refer the individual to an appropriate workforce partnership.  
3. Reassess the physical and mental fitness of the i ndividual.  
4. Coordinate with other federal, state, or local workforce or assistance programs to identify other work opportunities or assistance.  
STRATEGIC CO-ENROLLMENT 
Strategic co- enrollment is a holistic service approach that utilizes multiple program 
offerings to support participants and meet workforce development goals.  This strategy 
gives CWDs, state partners, and tribal organizations the opportunity to enhance and leverage local partnerships with entities that share similar resources, outcomes , and 
goals.  
All activities operated under the WIOA are allowable within the CalFresh E&T program, as outlined in 7 CF R 273.7(e)(2)(v) .  Activities offered through state or local programs 
often align with allowable CalFresh E&T components.  Individuals may co- enroll in both 
WIOA -funded and CalFresh E&T- funded services.  Providers of CalFresh E&T services 
and other workforce development networks often serve overlapping populations; strategic co- enrollment ensures services are not duplicated, nor opportunities missed.  
More information about co- enrollment can be found in All County Information Notice 
(ACIN) I -57-21. 
     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   27 | Page 
 PART III:  FISCAL POLICY  
The FNS annually provides the CDSS with federal grant money to operate the CalFresh 
E&T progra m.  These funds are known as “100 percent funds” and require no state fund 
match , in accordance with 7 C FR 273.7( d)(1)(i). 
In accordance with 7 CFR  273.7(d)(1)(i)(B)( 1-2), California’s E&T grant is calculated 
based on the statewide number of work registrants (90 percent) and the number of ABAWDs (10 percent), compared to the most recent nationwide statistics.  Funding for CalFresh E&T is not  dependent  on the number of individuals  participating  in the 
CalFresh E&T program . 
FUNDING CONTINGENCIES  
The CDSS receives funding for the CalFresh E&T program contingent upon 
congressional approval of the annual  SNAP E&T grant and FNS approval of the CDSS 
CalFresh E&T Annual Plan.  All entities responsible for the administration of the 
CalFresh E&T program are reliant on the FNS approval of the state plan as well as the CDSS approval of their individual CalFresh E&T plans.  
REALLOCATION OF FEDERAL FUNDS  
If a state  does not obligate or expend all of the funds allocated by the FNS for a fiscal 
year, those funds may be reallocated to other states’ agencies during the same fiscal 
year or the subsequent fiscal year, in accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(iii) .  The FNS 
will allocate carryover funding based on request s as appropriate and equitable, as 
described in 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(iii)(A -B). 
FUNDING BASICS 
There are three categories of funding available for CalFresh E&T:  
• 100 percent funds for administrative costs ; 
• 50 percent reimbursement funds for administrative costs; and  
• 50 percent reimbursement funds for participant reimbursements.  
Tribal organizations that offer a CalFresh E&T program are eligible for a higher federal reimbursement of expenditures made using non- federal funds for allowable CalFresh 
E&T costs .  The federal reimbursement rate for tribal organizations is 75 percent, rather 
than 50 percent, as outlined in  7 CFR 281.9(b) .  This includes both administrative costs  
and participant reimbursements.  
100 Percent Funds for Administrative Costs    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   28 | Page 
 The CWDs are allocated 100 percent funds based on the number of N on-Assist ance 
CalFresh (NACF)  households  within the county, in accordance with 7 CFR 
273.7(d)(1)(i) .  NACF is defined as a CalFresh household in which all members do not 
receive some type of public assistance in addition to CalFresh, including CalWORKs, 
Tribal TANF, Supplemental Security Incomes/State Supplementary Payment, and 
GA/GR.  
These funds may only be used for the administration of the CalFresh E&T program, 
which includes the planning, implementation, and operation of the program .  These 
funds may not be used to provide participant reimbursements .  Administrative costs 
paid with 100 percent funds must be reasonable, necessary, and directly related to an allowable CalFresh E&T component or service.  
50 Percent Funds for Administrative Costs 
All entities responsible for administering the CalFresh E&T program are eligible to receive 50 percent reimbursement for allowable non- federal funds spent to administer 
the program, in accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(c)(6)(iii) .  To be eligible for 50 percent 
reimbursement, these non- federal funds may only be used for the administration of the 
program, which includes the planning, implementation, and operation of the program.  These funds may not be used to provide participant reimbursements.  Administrative costs reimbursed with 50 percent funds must be reasonable, necessary, and directly 
related to an allowable component or service.   
50 Percent Funds for Participant Reimbursements  
All entities responsible for the administration of a CalFresh E&T program are required to 
provide reimbursement to participants for expenses that are reasonable, necessary, and 
directly related to participation in the CalFresh E&T program, in accordance with 7 CFR 
273.7(d)(4) . 
Participant reimbursements, also known as supportive services, include transportation, 
dependent care, and ancillary services .  Non -federal funds must be expended for all 
allowable E&T costs prior to reimbursement .  Non -federal funds used to provide 
allowable supportive services are eligible for 50 percent reimbursement by the CDSS . 
All entities responsible for administering the CalFresh E&T program may establish a 
limit on supportive services  offered, in accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(d)(4) .  Participants 
must be informed that allowable expenses will be reimbursed upon presentation of appropriate documentation. 
The CalFresh E&T Annual Plan must include information about the supportive services 
offered to participants .  Plans must specify the types of supportive services offered, 
whether supportive services are distributed as reimbursements or allowances, as well as the methods used to administer and track the supportive services.     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   29 | Page 
 Verification of cost and need for a supportive service is required prior to issuance.  The 
verification must demonstrate that the supportive service is necessary, reasonable, and directly related to participation in CalFresh E&T.  When documenting a supportive 
service, the component(s) in which a participant is enrolled must be tracked.  Records 
and/or copies of receipts for all supportive services issued, along with justification for 
each issuance, must be kept .  The CDSS can provide technical assistance regarding 
the types of supportive services allowable and eligible for reimbursement; however, each administrating entity is ultimately responsible for providing supportive services that 
are reasonable, necessary, and directly related to participation in their CalFresh E&T 
program.  
In accordance with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance P rogram (SNAP)  E&T 
Financial Policy  supportive services may not  be: 
• U sed for the purpose of overcoming barriers which exempt  individuals from 
federal work registration;  
• A vailable through another government program or available at no cost to the 
participant through a private source (e.g., charitable donations) ; 
• U sed to support a participant’s regular employment  unless  the participant is 
enrolled in the job retention component and the support ive service is linked to  
participation in that component; or  
• U sed to pay bad debt such as outstanding fines or fees or  make on -going regular 
payments.  
Internal Controls  
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.303, all entities receiving CalFresh E&T funds must 
establish and maintain effective internal control over the grant  that provides reasonable 
assurance that the entity is managing the CalFresh  E&T funds  in compliance with 
federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the program . 
Costs must be supported by documented policies and fiscal controls to approve and administer funds.  Establishing documented policies and segregating duties are two examples of internal controls which can help an entity ensure they establish and 
maintain effective internal control of the award.  
Transportation  
Participants must be reimbursed for the costs of transportation determined to be 
reasonable, necessary and directly related to participation in the CalFresh E&T program  
as outlined in 7 CFR 273.7(d)(4)(ii) . 
Such costs must be the actual costs incurred unless the entity responsible for administering CalFresh E&T has an approved method to provide allowances rather than 
reimbursements .  Participants must be provided an opportunity to claim actual    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   30 | Page 
 expenses up to the maximum level of reimbursement established by the responsible 
entity.  
Dependent Care  
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(d)(4)(i) , participants must be reimbursed for the cost of 
dependent care that is determined to be necessary and directly related to participation 
in CalFresh E&T, up to the actual cost of dependent care or the applicable payment rate 
for childcare, whichever is lowe r.  The payment rates for childcare are established in 
accordance with the Child Care and Development Block Grant provisions and are based on the Regional  Market R ate Sur vey.  More information on childcare payment rates is 
located on the CDSS Child Care and Development Fund State Plan webpage.  
Dependent care reimbursement must be provided to participants for all dependents requiring care unless otherwise prohibited.  Reimbursement for a dependent age 13 or older may not be provided unless the dependent is physically and/or mentally incapable of caring for themselves or is under court supervision.   Verification of the physical 
and/or mental incapacity for dependents age 13 or older must be obtained if the physical and/or mental incapacity is not readily apparent.  
A CalFresh E&T participant is not entitled to the dependent care reimbursement if a 
member of their  household provides the dependent care services .  Dependent care 
expenses beyond what is required for participation in CalFresh E&T activities are not eligible for 50 percent reimbursement .  Verification of the cost and the participant’s need 
for dependent care is required prior to the issuance of the supportive service.  The 
verification must include the name and address of the dependent care provider, cost, 
and the hours of service.  
In lieu of providing reimbursements for dependent care expenses, arrangements can be 
made for dependent care with providers through service contracts, vouchers, or other means.  A participant may refuse available dependent care if the participant can make 
other  arrangements , per 7 CFR 273.7(d)(4)(i) . 
Ancillary Expenses 
Ancillary expenses are costs incurred by the participant that are directly related to 
participation in the CalFresh E&T program .  Examples include uniforms, personal safety 
items, other necessary equipment, books or training manuals, internet costs, and housing subsidies.
 
ALLOWABLE COSTS  
While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations define what is 
allowable, costs covered by FNS for CalFresh E&T activities must meet a “necessary 
and reasonable” test , as outlined by 2 CFR 200.403 and 2 CFR 200.404.  To be 
allowable, administrative costs for  CalFresh E&T products and services must  be:    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   31 | Page 
 • D irectly related to an approved CalFresh E&T component or service;  
• N ecessary and reasonable;  
• Not for the purpose of overcoming barriers to work registration (i.e., drug or 
alcohol treatments and rehabilitation programs); and 
• Not a general expense required to carry out the overall responsibilities of a state or local government, such as a state’s funding for education provided for by statute.  
Reasonable Costs  
A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed what a prudent person would pay under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incur the cost.   To be considered reasonable, a cost must:  
• Provide a program benefit generally proportionate with the cost incurred;  
• Not be higher than the cost charged to the general public for the same service; 
and 
• Be within the scope of CalFresh E&T.  
Necessary Costs 
Necessary costs are incurred to carry out essential functions which cannot be avoided 
without adversely affecting program operation and do not duplicate existing efforts.   To 
be considered necessary, a cost must  be: 
• Incurred to carry out essential functions of CalFresh E&T;  
• U navoidable without adversely affecting program operations; and 
• Not duplicative of existing efforts.  
Outreach 
CalFresh E&T funds may be used to conduct outreach directed toward  CalFresh  
recipients  to inform them about the CalFresh E&T program, in accordance with 7 CFR 
277.4(b)(5) .  Recruitment activities designed to persuade an individual to apply for  
CalFresh benefits  are not allowable.   
A CalFresh  E&T pro vider  may conduct outreach to CalFresh recipients for the CalFresh 
E&T program via  radio, television,  social media, websites  or billboard advertisements . 
However , they cannot  promote CalFresh benefits or enrollment .   
UNALLOWABLE COSTS  
The following administrative costs are unallowable:     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   32 | Page 
 • Advertising  and public relations unless used for staff  recruitment , acquisition of 
material for the grant, or publishing the results of the grant  as outlined in 2 CFR 
200.421;  
• Alcoholic beverages  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.423;  
• Alumni activities  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.424;  
• Bad debt (includes late fees and/penalties)  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.426 and 2 
CFR 200.441;  
• Commencement and convocation costs  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.429;  
• Entertainment costs  as outlined in 2 CFR 200. 438;  
• Fines, violations or penalties for failure to comply with Federal, State or Local 
laws as outlined in 2 CFR 200.441;  
• Fundraising costs  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.442;  
• Goods and services for personal use as outlined in 2 CFR 200.445;  
• Housing and personal living expenses  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.445(b) ; 
• Interest fees, with certain exceptions  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.449; 
• Legal fees that result for a failure to follow f ederal, state or l ocal laws.  If certain 
conditions are met, the FN S may allow some legal fees in accordance with 2 
CFR 200.435; 
• Legislative expenses  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.450(c)(1)(iii) ; 
• Lobbying costs  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.450; 
• Losses on other awards or contracts in accordance with 2 CFR 200.451;  
• Membership costs , such as country club, social or dining  as outlined in 2 CFR 
200.454;  
• Political party expenses  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.450(c)(1)(ii) ; 
• Scholarships and student aid (except for Institutes of Higher Education)  as 
outlined in 2 CFR 200.466.   Does not apply to tuition costs related to the 
CalFresh E&T education component ;  
• Relocation costs of employees as outlined in 2 CFR 200.464;  
• Selling and marketing, unless approved and necessary for the performance of 
the grant  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.467; and 
• Student activity costs  as outlined in 2 CFR 200.469.  
SUPPLANTATION 
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(ii)(C) , CalFresh E&T funds must not be used to 
supplant non- federal funds for existing educational activities .  Education expenses are 
approvable to the extent that the component costs exceed the normal cost of services provided to persons not participating in CalFresh E&T.  
The CalFresh E&T program cannot be charged more than what the participant , as a 
member of  the general public , would pay if they were not enrolled in CalFresh E&T for 
any educational  activity .  CalFresh E&T funds  may be used to supplement (i.e.

 enhance), rather than supplant (i.e. replace), state or local funding for existing education 
services or activities .  For example, CalFresh E&T funds may be used to pay for some 
education and additional supportive services offered through community colleges, if 
these services are above and beyond those offered to non- CalFresh E&T participants.  
TIME RECORDS  
Time and effort reporting (timesheets) and/or time studies are required for staff paid 
through CalFresh E&T funds and those contributing to this work through cost share.  
The CDSS recommends keeping all records for a minimum of five years, as fiscal 
records must be produced in the event of a federal, state, county, single audit, CDSS 
Fiscal Monitoring Review (refer to County Fiscal Letter ( CFL) No. 19/20- 05), or 
CalFresh E&T Management Evaluation (ME). 
Time records are required for all CalFresh E&T staff and volunteers devoting less than 100 percent of their time to the program unless a federally approved random moments 
time study is used to allocate the time spent on allowable activities .  For counties and 
tribal organizations, substitute processes or systems for allocating salaries and wages 
to CalFresh E&T may be used in place of, or in addition to, the records  previously 
noted, if approved by the CDSS .  Such systems may include, but are not limited to: 
random moment sampling; “rolling” time studies ; case counts ; or other quantifiable 
measures of work performed, as outlined in 2 CFR 200.430(i) (5). 
PASS- THROUGH ENTIT IES 
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.1, a pass -through entity is a non- federal entity that 
receives federal funds and passes along those funds to subrecipients that carry out all 
or part of a federal program ’s services.  The CDSS is the pass -through entity for SNAP 
E&T and receives federal E&T funds that are passed through to the entities responsible 
for the administration of the program.  
Once an entity responsible for CalFresh E&T administration establishes an agreement 
with another entity to carry out all or part of the program ’s services, the y assume the 
role of a pass -through entity, including applicable accountability.  The entity  receiving 
CalFresh E&T funds through the pass -through entity likewise becomes  a subrecipient  of 
the organization that has provided those funds . 
Requirements for Pass- Through Entities  
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.332, entities responsible for the administration of a 
CalFresh E&T program that establish an agreement with another entity to provide all or part of the program services must:  
• Ensure that every subaward is clearly identified to the subrecipient as such;  
• Evaluate each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance with federal statutes,    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   34 | Page 
 regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward for purposes of 
determining the appropriate subrecipient monitoring; and 
• Monitor the activities of the subrecipient as necessary to ensure that CalFresh E&T funds are used for authorized purposes; in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward; and that performance goals are achieved.  
SUBRECI PIENTS 
As the direct recipient of the SNAP E&T grant, the CDSS is the primary pass -through 
entity for federal E&T funds .  Once a CWD, tribal organization, or state partner receives 
federal E&T funds from the CDSS, it  becomes a  "first tier" subrecipient.  
CWDs, tribal organizations , and state partners  may pass  federal E&T funds to their 
partners  through a subaward.  These subaward partners become “ second tier ” 
subrecipients, as referenced in CFL No. 21/22-115.  In the same way that CDSS is 
responsible for providing oversight over its subrecipients ; CWDs, tribal organizations, 
and state partners are responsible for providing proper oversight over their subrecipients.  
All first tier subrecipients must ensure that partners providing CalFresh E&T services are treated as subrecipients of the CalFresh E&T grant (rather than being treated as 
contractors ) and are provided the appropriate degree of oversight . 
Subrecipient Characteristics 
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.330(a) , a non-federal entity is classified as a subrecipient 
if they are responsible for  the following : 
• Determin ation of  who will receive CalFresh E&T services ; 
• Measurement  of their performance through successful completion of CalFresh 
E&T program objectives ; 
• P rogrammatic decision- making;  
• A dherence to applicable federal program requirements specified in CalFresh 
E&T; and 
• Delivery of program  services with CalFresh E&T funds as defined in statute .  
CONTRACTS AND PROCUREMENT  
Any solicitation for goods and/or services paid with CalFresh E&T funds and related to the operation and support of the program must be procured according to federal and state regulations .  All procurements must be reasonable and necessary  to the operation 
of the program .  The OMB clarifies several points regarding the updated procurement 
rules as part of the implementation of 2 CFR Part 200, also known as the “Uniform    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   35 | Page 
 Guidance. ”  All recipients of CalFresh E&T funds must adhere to these guidelines for 
procurement accordingly.  
Contractor Characteristics 
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.330(b) , a contract is for the purpose of obtaining goods 
and services for the non- federal entity's own use and creates a procurement 
relationship with the contractor .  In a procurement relationship, the contractor:  
• Provides the goods and services within normal business operations ; 
• Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers ; 
• Normally operates in a competitive environment ; 
• Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the operation of the federal 
program ; and  
• Is not subject to compliance requirements of the federal program as a result of the agreement, though similar requirements may apply for other reasons.  
For more information on making the distinction between subrecipients and contractor s, 
refer to CFL No. 21/22-115. 
COST PRINCIPLES  
Costs are classified as either direct or indirect .  In accordance with 2 CFR 200.412, a 
universal rule classifying certain costs as direct or indirect does not exist; however, costs incurred for the same or similar purpose should be charged consistently as either direct or indirect across an accounting system.  
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.413(a) , direct costs are those identified specifically with a 
final cost objective, such as a federal award or other internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities with a high degree of 
accuracy .  These costs must be directly tied to the production of specific goods or the 
provision of specific services .  Examples of direct costs include direct labor and direct 
materials.  
Indirect costs are those not readily identified with a specific project or organizational 
activity but  are incurred for the joint benefit of more than one project or activity .  Indirect 
costs are usually grouped into common pools and charged to benefiting objectives 
through an allocation process as part of a cost allocation plan ( typically for public 
assistance agencies) or calculated through the application of an indirect cost rate (ICR)  
that has been developed in coordination with an awarding agency  (for n on-public 
assistance agencies) .  Indirect costs include overhead expenses (e.g., rent and utilities) 
and general and administrative expenses (e.g., accounting and personnel department costs) (refer to 2 CFR 200.414).    
In accordance with 2 CFR Appendix VII to Part 200 A.4. , the types of costs which may    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   36 | Page 
 be classified as indirect cannot be specified in all situations.  However, typical examples 
of indirect costs include the following:  
• C ertain s tate/local -wide central service costs ; 
• Costs associated with program administration, such as accounting, and 
personnel services ; 
• D epreciation of buildings and equipment; and 
• Facility operation and maintenance costs.  
Indirect costs are allocated to multiple cost objectives after direct costs have been 
determined and charged to an award.  An indirect cost cannot be allocated to a final 
cost objective (i.e., a program)  if other costs incurred for the same purpose, or similar 
circumstances, have been included as a direct cost of that  objective , or another final 
cost objective (i.e., another program) .  This ensures that costs are allocated equitably 
across the programs for which an entity may perform activities and incur other costs. 
Salaries of administr ative and clerical staff who work on multiple projects, for example, 
are generally classified as indirect costs, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.413(c) .  It would 
be inappropriate to consider clerical staff divided between multiple projects to be direct 
costs under one project and indirect costs under another.  
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.403(d) , all costs must b e afforded consistent treatment .  
A cost may not be assigned to CalFresh E&T as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to CalFresh E&T as an indirect cost.  
Salaries/Wages 
Staff positions are accounted for in full time equivalents  and time spent on CalFresh 
E&T.  All positions must be attributed to staff  who directly recruit, train, place, support, 
coordinate, or supervise CalFresh E&T participants, or who develop materials used in 
such activities.  
As outlined in 2 CFR 200.430(i)(1) , charges to CalFresh E&T for salaries and wages 
must be based on official records that accurately reflect the work performed and 
compensated.  T hese records must:  
• Be supported by a system of internal control which provides reasonable assurance that the charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated;  
• Be incorporated into the official records of the entity responsible for the administration of the CalFresh E&T program ; 
• Reasonably reflect the total activity for which the employee is compensated, not exceeding 100 percent of compensated activities ; 
• Encompass federally assisted and all other activities compensated on an integrated basis but may include the use of subsidiary records as defined in    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   37 | Page 
 writte n policy ; 
• Comply with established accounting policies and practices; and 
• Support the distribution of the employee's salary or wages among specific 
activities or cost objectives if the employee works on more than one federal  
award; a federal award and non-f ederal award; an indirect cost activity and a 
direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities which are allocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or indirect cost activity. 
Fringe Benefits  
Fringe benefits must be allocated in a manner consistent with salary/wage costs  as 
outlined in 2 CFR 200.431.  Examples of fringe benefits eligible for reimbursement 
include:  
• Social Security tax ; 
• Medicare tax ; 
• State Unemployment Insurance; 
• Health insurance; 
• Dental insurance; 
• Life insurance; 
• Long- term disability ; 
• Short -term disability ; 
• Accidental death & dismemberment ; 
• Workers Compensation; 
• 403(b) Retirement plans ; 
• Retirement ; 
• Vacation pay; and 
• Sick pay . 
Materials/Supplies  
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.453, costs incurred for materials  and supplies  necessary 
to carry out the CalFresh E&T  program  are allow able.   Purchased materials and 
supplies must be charged at their actual prices, net of applicable credits.  Withdrawals 
from general stores or stockrooms must be charged at their actual net cost under any recognized method of pricing inventory withdrawals,  consistently applied.  Materials and 
supplies used for the performance of  the CalFresh E&T program  may be charged as 
direct costs.   
Travel Costs  
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.475, travel costs  are allowable expenses for    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   38 | Page 
 transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by employees who are 
on official business directly related to the CalFresh E&T program .  Such costs may be 
charged on an actual cost basis, per diem or mileage basis in lieu of actual costs 
incurred, or a combination of the two. T he method used must be applied to an entire trip 
and not to selected days, and result in charges consistent with those normally allowed 
in like circumstances and in accordance with the entity's written travel reimbursement 
policies.   Travel expenses do not  include participant r eimbursements for transportation.   
Building Space  
As outlined in CFL No. 20/21- 106, one allowable method for calculating the value of 
publicly owned space is depreciation.  Fair market rates may not be used for publicly 
owned space regardless of whether they are direct billed or donated.  The cost of space owned by a public agency is the acquisition cost of that space, plus maintenance and utilities .  Administering entities must describe the method used to calculate space value 
in the budget narrative submitted with the CalFresh E&T Annual Plan.  
Depreciation is the method for allocating costs of fixed assets to periods benefitting from asset use, as explained in 2 CFR 200.436.  Some assets, such as buildings, are always 
considered capital assets, while other assets, such as equipment, have a threshold for 
being considered capital assets.  
Leases/Rentals of Real Property 
As explained in 2 CFR 200.465(a) , rental costs are allowable to the extent that the rates 
are reasonable in light of such factors as: rental costs of comparable property, if any; market conditions in the area; alternatives available; and the type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the property leased.  
Rental arrangements should be reviewed periodically to determine if circumstances 
have changed and other options are available.  
Non-Short -Term Lea ses 
According to 2 CFR 200.465(c)(5) , rental costs under leases which are required to be 
treated as capital leases under generally accepted accounting principles are allowed 
only up to the amount that would be allowed had the non- federal entity purchased the 
property on the date the lease agreement was executed (an amount that would include expenses such as depreciation, maintenance, taxes, and insurance.)  
Interest fees related to capital leases are allowable to the extent that they meet the 
criteria in 2 CFR 200.449.  Unallowable costs include amounts paid for profit, 
management fees, and taxes that would not have been incurred had the non- federal 
entity purchased the property.  
    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   39 | Page 
 Equipment and other capital expenditures 
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.1, Equipment  means tangible personal property 
(including information technology systems) having a useful life of more than one year 
and a per -unit acquisition cost which equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization 
level established financial statement purposes, or $5,000.  
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.1, Capital Expenditures  means expenditures to acquire 
capital assets or expenditures to make additions, improvements, modifications, 
replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations, or alterations to capital 
assets that materially increase their value or useful life.  
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.439, the following rules of allowability must  be applied to 
equipment and other capital expenditures.    
• Receive approval from the CDSS prior to purchase of any assets or tangible 
property valued at more than $5,000, as per 7 CFR Part 277 Appendix A ; 
• Maintain a physical inventory every two years for any assets or tangible property that is paid for in full, or in part, with E&T funds; and 
• Adhere to the federal cost principles regarding the disposition of assets and 
tangible property in accordance with 2 CFR 200.313(e) . 
Participant Subsidized Wage Costs 
Participant subsidized wage costs include wage subsidies, payroll taxes and workers 
compensation costs paid by the CalFresh E&T provider and/or employer for eligible 
participants as part of an approved work -based learning activity, within the work 
experience component .  To receive reimbursement, the methodology for how costs 
were determined, including the number of participants, the hourly wage amount, the 
portion of the wage to be subsidized with E&T funds, and the number of hours must be 
included.  
Other Direct Costs 
Other direct costs to administer the CalFresh E&T program may  include p articipant 
training and/or certifications , program development , and participant t uition  costs.  
In-Kind Contributions  
In accordance with 7 CFR 277.4(e) , in-kind contributions are non- cash contributions  
which benefit the CalFresh E&T program and are contributed by a governmental entity, without charge, to another governmental entity .  Only governmental entities may receive 
reimbursements for in- kind contributions from other governmental entities.  
Entities t hat may not  receive reimbursement for in- kind contributions  include  private    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   40 | Page 
 entities, private universities, private non- profits, and public/private organizations.  
Indirect Costs 
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.414 , for entities such as non- profits that do not use 
public assistance cost allocation plans (PACAPs) to determine their indirect costs, the 
following guidance regarding indirect cost rates  (ICRs ) applies.  
An ICR is a device for fair and expeditious  determination of the proportion of general 
(non- direct) expenses that each project will bear .  It is the ratio between the total indirect 
costs and a direct cost base.  
𝑰𝑰𝒎𝒎𝒅𝒅𝒎𝒎𝑪𝑪𝑯𝑯𝑳𝑳𝒎𝒎  𝑪𝑪𝑯𝑯𝑯𝑯𝒎𝒎  𝑷𝑷𝑯𝑯𝑯𝑯𝑯𝑯  
𝑫𝑫𝒎𝒎𝑪𝑪𝑯𝑯𝑳𝑳𝒎𝒎  𝑪𝑪𝑯𝑯𝑯𝑯𝒎𝒎  𝑩𝑩𝑪𝑪𝑯𝑯𝑯𝑯=𝑰𝑰𝒎𝒎𝒅𝒅𝒎𝒎𝑪𝑪𝑯𝑯𝑳𝑳𝒎𝒎  𝑪𝑪𝑯𝑯𝑯𝑯𝒎𝒎  𝑹𝑹𝑪𝑪𝒎𝒎𝑯𝑯  
The ICR P
roposal must:  
• Be used to obtain reimbursement of organizational operational costs ; 
• Be prepared from audit financial statements and adjusted for unallowable costs ; 
• Identify all direct and all indirect costs ; 
• Select a direct cost base (DCB) ; and  
• Divide the indirect cost pool by the DCB . 
The ICR is expressed as a percentage.  The ICR multiplied by the DCB equals the 
indirect cost that may be charged to each program .  Indirect cost rates apply only to 
third parties acting as subrecipients  of CalFresh E&T funds, not  to contractors whose 
compensation should equal the contractually stipulated price of the goods and/or 
services they provide.  
Most n onprofit organizations have four options to recover costs expended in the 
process of managing federal awards : 
1. Federal  award recipients  may apply  for a federally  negotiated ICR from their 
cognizant agency.  
2. Subrecipients  may use a negotiated ICR with the pass -through entity .  
3. Eligible  non-federal  entities  may elect  to use a flat de minimis  rate of ten percent 
of modified total direct costs.  
4. Non-federal entities may charge costs that might otherwise be considered 
indirect costs directly (direct charge) if those costs are charged the same consistently  across  all federal  awards .  The salaries  of administrative and clerical 
staff should normally be treated as indirect .  Direct charging of these costs may 
be appropriate only if the conditions as outlined in 2 CFR 200.413 are met .  A 
reasonable basis for determining and allocating costs between programs/cost 
objectives must be developed and utilized, as explained in 2 CFR 200.405.    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   41 | Page 
 COST  ALLOCATION  PLAN  
A cost allocation plan (CAP)  is a narrative description of the procedures used by an 
entity to identify, accum ulate, and distribut e allowable costs of program administration 
together with the allocation methods used, in accordance with 7 CFR Appendix  A to 
Part 277 (B) .   
Central Service Cost Allocation Plan  
As described in 2 CFR Appendix V to Part 200 (A)(1) , most governmental entities  
provide certain services, such as motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, 
accounting, etc., to operating agencies on a centralized basis.  Since federally  
supported awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, there must  be 
a process whereby these central service costs can be identified and assigned to 
benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis.  The central service CAP 
provides that process.  
In accordance with 2 CFR Appendix V to Part 200 (D)(1) , the state  of California  must 
submit a plan to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for each year in 
which it claims central service costs under Federal awards.  The plan includes: 
• A projection of the next year's allocated central service cost (based either on 
actual costs for the most recently completed year or the budget projection for the coming year); and 
• A reconciliation of actual allocated central service costs to the estimated costs 
used for either the most recently completed year or the year immediately preceding the most recently completed year.  
Each major local government is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency 
for indirect costs annually.   In California , all counties  utilize CAPs  as approved by the 
State Controller’s Office , which is  recognized as the federally cognizant agency .  The 
countywide CAPs include all costs  to administer county services  such as the county 
park district,  animal control, and law enforcement costs.      
Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plan 
As described in 2 CFR Appendix VI to Part 200(A) , federally fina nced programs 
administered by public assistance agencies are funded predominately by the HHS.  The 
HHS publishe s requirements for the development, documentation, submission, 
negotiation, and approval of PACAPs.  All administrative costs (direct and indirect) are 
normally charged to Federal awards by implementing the PACAP.   
In California, all CWDs utilize the PACAP to account for and distribute costs  for federally 
financed programs  such as In- Home Supportive Services, CalWORKs and CalFresh.   
The CDSS’ methodology for allocation of these costs is by use of the County Expense    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   42 | Page 
 Claim (CEC) in the County Expense Claim Reporting Information System (CECRIS) 
(formerly the CEC in FoxPro) and time study hours recorded by county workers as 
defined in the Fiscal Year County Cost Allocation Plan , located on the CDSS Budget 
and Fiscal New s webpage.  These costs are calculated by taking indirect cost pools 
within the PACAP, such as the support operating pool, and allocating a percentage of 
the amount in those cost pools to the CalFresh E&T program based on a ratio of CalFresh E&T time study hours to total time study hours.  
County Claim Process  
California’s welfare programs are state- supervised and county -administered.  Under this 
state -supervised arrangement, the CDSS issues regulations to the CWDs on how the 
programs are to be administered.  The CDSS sets standards for obtaining state and federal reimbursement for costs incurred for the administration of county welfare programs .  Conversely, the CDSS enters into agreements  directly with tribal 
organizations and state partners for the provision of CalFresh E&T services and issues 
reimbursement for allowable E&T expenditures in accordance with the terms outlined in 
the agreement . 
The CECRIS is used by counties to request reimbursement for costs to the CalFresh 
E&T program by submitting their claims for reimbursement through CECRIS in accordance with state claiming instructions contained in the relevant CFLs .  These 
claiming instructions may be found on the CFL page of CDSS’ public website. 
CalFresh E&T funding is available to the CWDs based on reimbursement through the claiming structures the CDSS has established in CECRIS .  Funds for allowable 
activities must first be expended by the CWD t o be eligible for reimbursement .  Upon 
receipt of a claim through CECRIS, the CDSS reimburses CWDs for the appropriate percentage (100 percent or 50 percent) of allowable expenditures.  
     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   43 | Page 
 PART IV:  DATA AND REPORTING 
Federal and state regulations require all entities responsible for the administration of 
CalFresh E&T to report participant and program data to the CDSS .  To meet these 
requirements, the following reports must be submitted by specified deadlines within the FFY:  
• Participant Outcomes Report ; 
• CalFresh Work Registrants, Able- Bodied Adults Without Dependents  
(ABAWDs) , Employment and Training (E&T)  Program Quarterly Statistical 
Report (STAT 47); and 
• CalFresh E mployment &Training (E&T)  Progress Report . 
DEFINITIONS  
Participant 
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(c)(11)(iii) , the definition of a CalFresh E&T participant 
is a CalFresh applicant or recipient who engages in at least one part of the program; 
including  orientation, assessment, case management, or a component.  
Therefore, all individuals who engage in any CalFresh E&T activity, even if they do not 
engage in further component activities, are categorized as CalFresh E&T participants 
and must be captured for reporting purposes .  An individual who is referred to case 
management, assessment, or orientation, but fails to attend is not considered a participant for reporting purposes.  
Component  
A CalFresh E&T component is defined as a service, activity, or program designed to help CalFresh recipients gain skills, training, or work experience.  Components include but are not limited to  education, job retention, self -employment training, supervised job 
search, workfare , and work experience.  
Component Completion  
As explained in SNAP Clarification of E&T Outcome Reporting Requirements Q&A Part 
II, #13, the definition of “component completion” for the measure outlined in 7 CFR  
273.7(c)(17)(iv)  requires all entities responsible for the administration of the CalFresh 
E&T program to determine whether the participant completed all requirements of the component.  
If an individual is enrolled in multiple components, each component must be assessed for completion.  If there is a component end date, there must  be a corresponding 
completion status.     
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   44 | Page 
 Program Completion  
As outlined in SNAP Clarification of E&T Outcome Reporting Requirements Q&A Part II,  
#8, the definition of “completion of participation” for the measures in 7 CFR 
273.7(c)(17)(i) -(iii), must be determined using a 90 day “look back” period.  
The CalFresh E&T program completion date or “exit date” is the last date of service.  
The last day of service cannot be determined until 90 days have elapsed since the 
participant last received services (not including job retention services) .  If a particip ant 
reengages in the CalFresh E&T program 90 days or more since their previous program 
completion date, they are considered a new participant for reporting purposes .  This 
principle is referred to as the “90 day look back” rule.  
PARTICIPANT OUTCOMES REPORT  
The CDSS is required to submit the Participant Outcomes Report to the FNS by 
January 1 of each year, in accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(c)(17) . 
The federal reporting requirements were established by the Interim Final Rule:  
Supplemental Nutri tion Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment and Training  Program 
Monitoring,  Oversight, and Reporting Measures, Volume 81 of the Federal Register, 
page 15613.  The reporting requirements are comprised of outcome measures based on the employment and earnings of current and former CalFresh E&T participants to monitor the effectiveness of the CalFresh E&T program and services.  
The r
eport must include a unique line of data for each individual and the C alFresh E&T 
activity and/or component in which the individual participated.  For example, if an individual participated in orientation/assessment and supervised job search, there would be two lines of data for that individual with relevant dates.  
The CDSS  match es the CalFresh E&T participant and former participant information 
against wage data provided by the California Employment Development Department (EDD) .  The CDSS has a n MOU with the EDD, which allows the CDSS to access wage 
data for all CalFresh rec ipients.  
Data Elements 
The following data elements are required for each participant:

to the ABAWD  Handbook. 
HSD OR GED PRIOR TO CALFRESH 
E&T SERVICES  Participants can self -report whether 
they have received an HSD or GED  
prior  to starting CalFresh E&T 
services.  
ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE CalFresh E&T participants who 
speak English  as a second 
language.   This is meant to capture 
all participants who speak a 
language other than English as their 
first language, regardless of 
whether they also speak English or 
because this poses a barrier to 
employment.   Participants can self -
report this information.  
MANDATORY OR 
VOLUNTARY  In California, all entities responsible 
for the administration of Cal Fresh 
E&T and participants, are voluntarily 
participating.   Therefore,  all  
participants must be reported as 
voluntary.

  CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022  48 | PagePART V: MANAGEMENT EVALUATION  
The CDSS conducts MEs of all entities  responsible for the administration of the 
CalFresh E&T program .  The purpose of the ME is to determine compliance with 
CalFresh E&T rules , regulations , and approved Annual Plan; identify and document 
effective practices in places that could be helpful to other programs; identify technical 
assistance needs; and provide an opportunity for feedback to the CDSS on areas for 
continuous improvement.

and validation methodologies for the “ CalFresh Work Registrants, Able- Bodied Adults 
Without Dependents  (ABAWDs) , and Employment and Training (E&T)  Program 
Quarterly Statistical Report (STAT 47)” , and the “ CalFresh E&T Participant Outcomes 
Report ”. 
Civil Rights Review  
All programs and services funded by the FNS must include a public notification system .  
The purpose of this system is to inform applicants, participants, and potentially eligible persons of the program availability, rights and responsibilities, policy of 
nondiscrimination, and the procedure for filing a complaint.  
All handouts, forms, and informational materials provided to CalFresh E&T participants 
must include the FNS funding statement and the nondiscrimination statement according to FNS Instruction 113 -1, Section IX  and 2 CFR 415.2(b) .   
The nondiscrimination statement is as follows:   
In accordance with Federal law and U.S. Department of Agriculture policy, this 
institution is prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, 
sex, age, religion, political beliefs, or disability.  
To file a complaint of discrimination, write USDA, Director, Office of Civ il Rights, 
1400 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20250- 9410 or call (800) 795-
3272 (voice) or (202) 720- 6382 (TTY).  USDA is an equal opportunity provider and 
employer.

following abbreviated statements:  
• Funding provided by USDA ; 
• Funding for research provided by USDA; or  
• Funding for this project was provided by the USDA.  
Fiscal Review 
The purpose of the fiscal review is to determine if costs charged to the CalFresh E&T 
program match the approved CalFresh E&T Annual Plan Budget and are allowable, 
reasonable, necessary, and allocable in accordance with 7 CFR 273.7 and 2 CFR 
200.403. 
The CDSS ME team will review fiscal policies and accounting records, including time 
records , to ensure documentation is maintained in a manner that permits verification of 
all costs charged to the CalFresh E&T program .  The CDSS ME team will evaluate the 
fiscal systems and safeguards in place to ensure fiscal integrity .  Additionally, the CDSS 
ME team will evaluate the methodology used for allocating costs to the CalFresh E&T 
program in accordance with federal guidance.  
Exit Conference  
An exit conference will be conducted upon completion of the ME visit to provide a 
summary of the review and to discuss any additional documentation needed.  During  
this exit conference, the CDSS CalFresh E&T ME team will discuss program highlights, 
observations, and/or findings discovered during the ME.  
Highlights  
One of the objectives of the CalFresh E&T ME is to identify, describe, and document 
effective practices .  These best practices may inform future program development 
across the state. 
Observations  
Any policy, procedure or practice identified by the CDSS ME team as a program weakness or area needing improvement is considered an observation.  Observations have the potential to become findings if program policies, procedures, and/or practices are not strengthened or improved upon.  The CDSS will provide a recommendation for    
 
CalFresh E&T Handbook 2022   53 | Page 
 each observation identified.  
Findings  
Any policy, procedure, or practice identified by the CDSS ME team that is not in 
compliance with federal or state regulations, FNS i nstructions, and/or policy memos is a 
finding.  All findings included in the report require corrective action.  
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN 
A finalized ME report will be submitted to the entity responsible for the administration of the CalFresh E&T program within 60 days following the conclusion of the ME .  In 
accordance with 7 C FR 275.16, a written response is required identifying actions that 
are proposed or taken in response to all observation(s) and finding(s) of noncompliance with federal regulations .  The term “Required Corrective Action” is the element of the 
ME report that conveys the action(s) that must be taken to correct the noncompliance with federal regulations, FNS instructions, and/or policy memoranda prescribed by the FNS and/ or the CDSS.  
A CAP must be submitted to the CDSS within 60 calendar days after receipt of the ME 
report.   The CAP must address all findings and show evidence of the following:  
• Evaluation of the finding(s) ; 
• Identification of the root cause(s) of the finding(s) ; 
• Magnitude and geographic extent of deficiency ; 
• Determination of the corrective action(s) necessary to address the root cause(s) 
and correct the finding in a sustainable manner ; 
• Identification of the timeframes related to each corrective action (i.e. major 
milestone dates, target completion date) ; 
• Identification of the staff responsible or the point of contact for each corrective 
action;  
• Basis for the development of the plan, implementation, and evaluation of the corrective actions ; 
• Description of how the entity will monitor the corrective action;  
• Description of how the entity will determine whether the corrective action is 
successful in addressing the root causes; and 
• Documentation/evidence for any corrective action that has been implemented.  
The CDSS will determine whether the corrective actions proposed in the CAP are adequate to resolve any findings.  Once acceptable corrective actions have been 
implemented and adequate verification has been provided, the CDSS will issue a 
closeout letter to confirm the finding(s) have been closed.   The CDSS will support all 
entities responsible for administration of the CalFresh E&T program in aligning their 
program and services with all federal and state regulations and policies.

making such determinations.  Limiting verification to parole authority 
established violations is recommended because it is both cost effective

CDSS recommends that eligibility workers limit their verification of 
probation violations to those violations which have already been 
investigated and officially established by the courts responsible fo r 
supervision of probation in accordance with the formal processes of 
those courts for making such determinations.  Limiting verification to 
court established violations is recommended because it is both cost

benefit a cash amount in lieu of food stamp benefits; 2) all SSI/SSP recipients in 
California are ineligible to receive food stamps.  A person must actually receive, not 
merely have applied for, SSI/SSP benefits to be determined ineligible for the Food Stamp 
Program.  If the CWD provides payments at least equal to the level of SSI/SSP benefits to 
persons who have been determined eligible for SSI/SSP awaiting receipt of SSI/SSP 
benefits, receipt of these substitute payments will terminate Food Stamp Program 
eligibility.  Once receiving SSI/SSP benefits, the person will remain ineligible for food

commercial boarding house.  A reasonable monthly payment shall be either of the following: 
 
.311 Where board arrangement is for more than two meals a day a boarder shall pay an amount

providing the board.  The household with which the boarder resides (including the household of 
the proprietor of a boarding house) may participate in the Program, if the household meets all the 
eligibility requirements for Program participation.  A boarder may participate as a member of the 
household at the household's request.  If an applicant household identifies any individual in the 
household as a boarder, the following provision applies: 
 
.321 Such individuals shall not be considered a member of participant or applicant household, 
nor shall the income and resources of boarders be considered available to such 
households.  However, the amount of payment that a boarder gives to a household for 
lodging and meals shall be treated as self-employment income to the household.  The 
procedures for handling self-employment income from boarders (other than such income 
received by a household that owns and operates a commercial boarding house) are

 .82 Households with striking members shall be ineligible to participate in the Food Stamp Program 
unless the household was eligible one day prior to involvement in the strike action and on the date 
of application.  The CWD shall perform two separate eligibility determinations. 
 
 
 
 .821 To determine pre-strike eligibility, consider the day prior to the member’s involvement in 
the strike as the day of interview and assume the strike did not occur. 
.822 To determine eligibility, compare the striking member’s income before the strike to the 
striker’s income which can be antici pated with reasonable certainty during the strike, 
(e.g., income from the receipt of strike benefits or temporary employment during the 
strike).  The higher of the two amounts shall be added to the income of nonstriking 
members during the month of application.  
.823 To determine benefits, deductions shall be calculated for the month of application as for 
any household.  Whether the striker’s prestrike income or income during the strike is 
used, the earned income deduction shall be allowed if applicable.  Benefit level of an 
eligible striker household is based on current circumstance except for income as specified 
above. 
.83 CWDs shall use the method as specified in Section 63-402.82 in determining benefits and 
eligibility for continuing households when a member becomes involved in a strike.  Such a 
household shall not receive an increased allotment as the result of a decrease in the income of the 
striking member(s) of the household. 
 
 
 .84 The household’s income immediately prior to the involvement in the str ike action at the date of 
application shall be verified at the time of application.  Any anticipated income during the strike 
shall also be accounted for at this time.  It is the responsibility of the household to provide the 
CWD with verification of such income for the purpose of determining eligibility and benefit levels 
in accordance with Section 63-300.5. 
.85 Strikers shall be subject to the work registration requirements unless exempt under Section 63-
407.2.

.1 Noncitizen Eligibility 
 
Certain legal noncitizens of the United States (U.S.) shall be eligible for CFAP if they are not eligible for 
federal Food Stamp (FS) benefits, based solely on their immigration status under the Personal 
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 as amended by the Food Stamp 
Reauthorization Act of 2002.  Legal presence can be verified through USCIS at application [i.e. 
Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) System].  Legal noncitizens whose time limit has 
expired for the federal program but would otherwise remain eligible for federal benefits are eligible for 
CFAP. 
 
.11 Victims of trafficking, domestic violence, or other serious crimes. 
 
Welfare and Institutions Code Section 18945 established eligibility for this group of noncitizens. 
Eligibility rules are outlined in Sections 42-431.23, .3, .4, .5, and .6.  Examples of documentation 
to be considered in determining an applicant’s experience with human trafficking, domestic 
violence, or other serious crimes can be found in Sections 42-431.4, .5 and .6. 
 
.2 Application of Existing Regulations 
 
Current federal FSP regulations contained in the State FSP Manual (Division 63 of the CDSS Manual of 
Policies and Procedures) will apply to the CFAP and its participants unless otherwise stated.  For CFAP 
recipients who do not meet exemptions from deeming, the period for deeming of a sponsor’s income and 
resources shall be three years from the date of the sponsor’ s execution of the 213A Affidavit of Support. 
 Victim s of abuse by their sponsor or sponsor’s spouse shall be exempt from deeming.  
 
.21 Existing federal FSP regulations apply to victims of human trafficking, domestic violence, or 
other serious crimes, expect where otherwise indicated. 
 
.211 As a condition of eligibility, when the noncitizen victim of human trafficking, domestic 
violence, or other serious crimes does not have permission to work in the United States 
and the Social Security Administration will not issue a social security number, this 
requirement is suspended until such time as the individual's ability to obtain a social 
security number changes.

work requirements.  This includes the Able-Bodied Adult Without Dependents (ABAWD) work 
requirement, and requirements for food stamp work registration and participation in the Food 
Stamp Employment and Training (FSET) program.  In addition, recipients shall not be subject to 
penalties for voluntary quit and reduction of hours worked.  However, this group may participate 
in other education or training to the extent such participation is permissible. 
 
.4 Combined Households 
 
For CFAP purposes, combined households are those which contain participants of the federal FSP and 
CFAP.  No household shall receive more food stamp benefits under CFAP than it would have received if 
all members had remained eligible for the federal FSP.

household member or shall provide verification of application for an SSN prior to certification.  If 
individuals have more than one number, all numbers shall be required. 
 
.11 The CWD shall explain to applicants and recipients that refusal or failure without good cause to 
provide or apply for an SSN shall result in disqualification of the individual for whom the SSN is 
not obtained.  The CWD shall send the household a notice of action explaining the effect of the 
disqualification on the eligibility and allotment of the remaining household members. 
 
.12 For those individuals who provide SSNs prior to certification, recertification, or at any office 
contact, the CWD shall record the SSN and verify in accordance with Section 63-404.6.

.13 Household members who do not have an SSN and who apply for an SSN or provide good cause 
for failure to apply shall be allowed to participate in accordance with Section 63-404.3. 
 
.2 Exemption for Expedited Processing Applicants 
 
.21 Households entitled to expedited service shall not be required to furnish or apply for an SSN until 
after they have received their first allotment.  However, these households shall be required to 
furnish or apply for an SSN before their next issuance in accordance with 63-301.543 and .544. 
 
.3 Obtaining the Social Security Number 
 
.31 Whenever an individual indicates he/she does not have an SSN, or is otherwise unable to provide 
one, the household member shall complete the application for SSNs provided by the CWD, and 
apply directly to the Social Security Administration (SSA). 
 
 
 
 .32 The CWD shall inform the household member where to apply and what information will be 
needed. 
.33 The CWD shall inform the household member that proof of application from the SSA will be 
required prior to certification. 
.34 Once the household member has filed an application for an SSN and continue to meet all other 
eligibility requirements, that member shall be permitted to continue to participate pending 
notification of the CWD through IEVS of the household member ’s verified SSN. 
.4 Failure to Comply 
 
.41 If the CWD determines that a household member has failed without good cause to provide or 
apply for an SSN that individual shall be ineligible to participate until he/she complies.  This 
disqualification will apply only to the individual for which the SSN is not provided and not to the 
entire household. 
 
.42 Income of the disqualified individual shall be treated as outlined in Section 63-502.14.  Resources 
of the disqualified individual shall be treated as outlined in Section 63-501.9. 
 
.5 Good Cause Determination 
 
.51 In determining if good cause existed for failure to comply with the SSN requirement to apply for 
or provide the CWD with an SSN, the CWD shall consider information provided by the household 
member and SSA.  Documentary evidence or collateral information that the household member 
has applied for an SSN or made every effort to supply SSA with the necessary information to 
complete and application for an SSN shall be considered good cause for not complying timely 
with this requirement.

participate, good cause shall be shown monthly. 
.53 If the household member applying for an SSN has been unable to obtain the documents required 
by SSA, the CWD should make every effort to assist the individual in obtaining these documents. 
.61 The CWDs shall submit SSNs through IEVS to SSA for verification.

application from SSA.  Approved documentation includes, but is not limited to, the MC-194, the 
SSA 5028 or the hospital issued SSA- 2853-OP4. 
.63 Certification for or issuance of benefits shall not be delayed to an otherwise eligible household

.64 Once an SSN has been verified through IEVS, the EW shall annotate the casefile accordingly to 
prevent the need for future reverification.

parents (up through the quarter the applicant turned 18, including credits earned before 
the child was born) and/or spouse (for work performed during their marriage and the 
noncitizen remains married to such spouse or such spouse is deceased) lived in the United 
States?  If the period of time is more than 10 years, it is not necessary to ask question B 
(Section 63-405.412).  Skip to question C (Section 63-405.413).  However, if the period 
of time is less than 10 years, question B (Section 63-405.412) shall be asked. 
 
 .412 Did the applicant noncitizen, the applicant noncitizen’s parents (up through the quarter 
the applicant turned 18, including credits earned before the child was born) and/or spouse 
(for work performed during their marriage and the noncitizen remains married to such 
spouse or such spouse is deceased) ever perform work for a United States business or the 
U.S. government, while not residing in the United States?  If so, for how many calendar 
quarters or years?  If an applicant noncitizen neither lived in the U.S. at least 10 years, or 
worked for a United States business or the U.S. government while living in another 
country; or if the combination of years lived in the United States and worked for a United 
States business or the U.S. government while living in another country totals less than 10 
years, then the applicant noncitizen shall be denied food stamps.  If the total is at least 10 
years, then question C (Section 63-405.413) shall be asked. 
.413 In how many of the years reported in answer to question A (Section 63-405.411) did the 
applicant noncitizen, the applicant noncitizen’s parents (up through the quarter the 
applicant noncitizen turned 18, including credits earned before the child was born) and/or 
spouse (for work performed during their marriage and the noncitizen remains married to 
such spouse or such spouse is deceased) earn money through work?  If the answer is at 
least 10 years, or if the answer combined with the answer to question B (Section 63-
405.412) is at least 10 years, then the earnings of the noncitizen whose eligibility is in 
question shall be verified before eligibility is established, except as specified in Section 
63-405.112(g)(2).  If the total is less than 10 years, then the applicant noncitizen shall be 
denied food stamps.

 Page 174.5 .42 The preferred method of verifying qualifying credits of employment is through the Social Security 
Administration’s (SSA’s) automated system.  However, the automated system may not always 
verify that the earnings requirement is met.  If the noncitizen believes that the records provided by 
the automated system are incorrect, the CWD shall inform the noncitizen of the option of 
challenging SSA’s records.  The person whose work history is in question can visit the nearest 
SSA office and request a review to determine if the qualifying quarters are met.  A document from 
SSA indicating that a determination of work credits is under review must be provided to the 
CWD.  If for some reason the person whose work history is in question is unable or unwilling to 
appear in person to request an investigation of SSA’s records, they can be requested for that 
person through the mail.  A noncitizen disputing SSA’s findings, and requesting a review through 
SSA’s manual system, shall be allowed to participate until SSA completes its investigation, or for 
a maximum of six months from the date of the original determination of insufficient quarters. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 All or part of the qualifying credits of employment may be verified by information provided by the 
household.  The CWD shall accept employer-prepared wage statements, W-2 or W-2c forms, a 
copy of the federal or state income tax return, etc., as proof of earnings.  The normal application 
processing time frames apply if the CWD is obtaining verification of work credits from the 
household. 
.43 After all the earnings are obtained for or on behalf of the noncitizen whose eligibility is in 
question, the CWD shall u se the “ESTABLISHING QUARTERS” chart below to determine if the 
amount of earnings is sufficient to establish the required number of credits.

ESTABLISHING QUARTERS 
The term “quarter” means the 3 calendar month periods ending wit h March 31, June 30, 
September 30, and December 31 of any year. 
 
 Social Security credits (formerly called “quarters of coverage”) are earned by working at a job or 
as a self employed individual.  A maximum of 4 credits can be earned each year.

For 1978 and later, credits are based solely on the total yearly amount of earnings.  All types of 
earnings follow this rule.  The amount of earnings needed to earn a credit increases and is 
different for each year.  For 1978 forward, the amount of earnings needed for each credit is: 
 
1978 ............................ $250  
1979 ............................ $260  
1980 ............................ $290  
1981 ............................ $310  
1982 ............................ $340  
1983 ............................ $370  
1984 ............................ $390  
1985 ............................ $410  
1986 ............................ $440  
1987 ............................ $460  
1988 ............................ $470  1989 ...........................  $500 
1990 ...........................  $520 
1991 ...........................  $540 
1992 ...........................  $570 
1993 ...........................  $590 
1994 ...........................  $620 
1995 ...........................  $630 
1996 ...........................  $640 
1997 ...........................  $670 
1998 ...........................  $700 
1999 ...........................  $740 
2000 ...........................  $780         
 
 
 
 
 A current year quarter may be included in the 40 quarter computation. 
To determine the number of credits, divide the individual’s total yearly earnings by the amount 
shown above for that year.  For example, earnings of $1360 in 1982 results in four credits ($1360 
divided by 340).  DO NOT CREDIT CALENDAR QUARTERS THAT HAVE NOT ENDED.  
If you need to use quarters before 1978: 
 A credit  was earned for each calendar quarter in which an individual was paid $50 or 
more in wages (including agricultural wages for 1951-1954);  
 Four credits were earned for each taxable year in which an individual’s net earnings from 
self-employment were $400 or more; and/or 
 
 A credit was earned for each $100 (limited to a total of 4) of agricultural wages paid 
during the year for years 1955 through 1977. 
 
 HANDBOOK ENDS HERE  
 
.44 If upon further review SSA cannot establish additional earnings and the noncitizen does not have 
at least 40 qualifying credits, the CWD shall establish an inadvertent household error claim for 
over issuance for the months food stamps were received.

.1 An on-line Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) System is an issuance system in which benefits are 
stored in a central computer database and electronically accessed by cardholders at a POS terminal, 
ATM, and other electronic fund transfer device utilizing a reusable plastic card.  
.11 When determined eligible, the recipient's benefit information is electronically loaded each 
month into a central computer account during the certification period. 
.12 A magnetic-stripe plastic card is used to access the recipient's account in lieu of issuing food 
stamp coupons to purchase food items at authorized food retailers or in lieu of issuing cash 
warrants to purchase goods or services.  Cardholders shall use the same EBT card to access 
food stamp and cash benefit accounts (if the CWD elects to issue cash benefits through the 
EBT system). 
.13 The cardholder will access the benefit account by swiping the EBT card through a POS 
terminal at a retailer for a purchase transaction.  The following is a brief general description 
of the steps of a transaction: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 .131 Connect on-line to the central processor database; 
.132 Verify the validity of the Personal Identification Number (PIN), card number and the 
amount of available benefits in an EBT account; 
.133 Obtain authorization for each purchase; 
.134 Initiate the debiting of the recipient's account and the crediting of the retailer's 
account;

CalFresh ABAWD Time Limit Questions and Resources
What is the ABAWD Time Limit?
The ABAWD time limit is a federal rule. People who are considered ABAWDs are limited to 3 full months of CalFresh benefits every 36-months (3 years). ABAWDs may receive benefits for longer than 3 months if they are working, excused from the time limit, or are living in an area that is waived from the time limit.
People who are ABAWDs must do certain work-related activities to remain eligible for CalFresh for more than 3 months. They must be working or doing approved work activities for at least 80 hours per month. This includes paid work, unpaid work, and in-kind work. In-kind work is working in exchange for a service, such as working off rent. The county can help connect ABAWDs with local work opportunities in the area to meet the ABAWD work rules.
It is important to note that not all counties in California have a time limit, some counties are waived from the ABAWD time limit rules if the county meets certain criteria – like having a high unemployment rate. Counties that do not meet the criteria to be waived must have the ABAWD time limit rule in place.
Who is an ABAWD?
An ABAWD is a person:
   * Between the ages of 18 and 54,
   * Who can work, and
   * Who does not have children under age 18 living in the CalFresh household.
When the ABAWD time limit is in place, ABAWDs must work or participate in a work activity to keep their CalFresh benefits for longer than 3 months unless they are excused from ABAWD rules.
Who is not an ABAWD?
You are not an ABAWD if:
   * You are under age 18 or over age 54
   * Have children under age 18 in your CalFresh household
   * You are excused from the general CalFresh work rules if you are:
   * Younger than age 16, or age 60 or older.
   * Caring for a dependent child under age 6 (they do not have to live with you).
   * Caring for a person with a disability (they do not have to live with you).
   * Working at least 30 hours a week or earning at least $217.50 (current federal minimum wage x 30 hours) each week before taxes.
   * Getting or applying for unemployment benefits.
   * Getting or applying for disability benefits from any source (disability benefits include, but are not limited to pensions, workers’ compensation, disability insurance, Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran’s benefits).
   * Disabled.
   * Going to school, college, or a training program at least half-time (additional student eligibility rules may apply).
   * Meeting work rules for another program, like CalWORKs.
   * In a drug or alcohol abuse treatment program.
How can you be excused from the ABAWD time limit?
You may be excused from the ABAWD time limit if you are:
   * Unable to work at least 20 hours per week or a total of 80 hours or more per month because of a physical or mental health issue.
   * Unable to work at least 20 hours per week or a total of 80 hours or more per month because of a personal issue including if you are:
   * Struggling with a drug or alcohol problem.
   * A victim of domestic violence.
   * Living in a CalFresh household with a child under age 18 (this can be your own child, sibling, or any other child in your CalFresh household).
   * Pregnant (any stage of pregnancy).
   * Experiencing homelessness.
   * A veteran who served in the armed forces of the United States (this includes veterans who were honorably or dishonorably discharged).
   * Under age 25 and were in foster care on your 18th birthday.
ABAWD Time Limit Counties in California
The USDA FNS approved California’s statewide ABAWD time limit waiver request starting November 1, 2024 through October 31, 2025. This new one-year statewide waiver will begin after our current 24-month statewide waiver ends on October 31, 2024.
This means no ABAWDs living in California will have to meet the work requirement to keep receiving CalFresh benefits. ABAWDs who have lost their CalFresh benefits may reapply and continue to receive CalFresh if otherwise eligible.

For immediate food assistance, find your local food bank. You can also call 2-1-1, a resource helpline for referrals for childcare, affordable housing or shelter, cash assistance, healthcare and more.
Applying for CalFresh
How quickly will I get benefits?
Your county has 30 days to approve or deny your case. Some people with very low income can get expedited services, and their cases should be processed in 3 days. Because of the pandemic, counties are receiving a higher volume of applications than normal. It may take longer than usual to hear back. If it’s been more than two weeks and you haven’t gotten any mail or phone calls from your county, or you want to contact your county office, you can find their phone number here.
I just lost my job - how does that affect my application for CalFresh?
You can definitely apply for CalFresh if you just lost your job. If your income recently stopped, your county will only count any final payments you got in the last 30 days to calculate how much CalFresh you will receive in the first month. If you still have any income, your ongoing benefits will be based only on that income, not income that has stopped. You should provide proof of any money you got in the last 30 days if you can.
It isn't required, but it can be helpful to provide any proof you have that your income has stopped. This could be a letter, or a screenshot of an email or text from your employer that explains that you are no longer working. If you can’t get proof, write a letter that explains that you aren’t working. Make sure to include the last date you worked, and sign and date it.
If I still have a job but don’t have hours and am not getting paid, what do I put for my income?
If your income has decreased or stopped, you can upload proof of income for the last 30 days through getcalfresh.org/docs. If your income went up and you aren’t sure if you need to report changes, you can call your county to get more information. You can find their contact information here.
What do I need to know about CalFresh and unemployment benefits?
You can get CalFresh and unemployment benefits at the same time, as long as the amount of money you get from unemployment isn't over the CalFresh income limits. You can start a CalFresh application and we’ll help you figure out if you’re over the limit. Getting CalFresh won't affect how much money you get from unemployment.
If you applied for unemployment but haven't gotten money from unemployment yet, you don't have to report it on your CalFresh application. If you get CalFresh right now and have started receiving unemployment or the amount you get has changed, we recommend reaching out to your county CalFresh office to let them know about your income changes. They will give you next steps based on your situation.
What documents should I submit with my application?
The documents you need to submit depends on your situation. When you apply on GetCalFresh.org, you will be given a list of recommended documents to submit. These documents are usually required to get CalFresh:
   * A copy of your ID
   * Proof of any income
   * Proof of immigration status (for non-citizens)
   * Proof of student status (for college students)
These documents are optional but can increase your benefit amount:
   * Proof of housing expenses
   * Proof of child support that you pay
   * Proof of child/dependent care that you pay for
   * If you are 60+ or disabled, proof of medical expenses.
If you can’t get proof, the CalFresh office will generally accept a written statement explaining your situation - make sure it is signed and dated. Submitting all of your documents with the application can help you skip the interview (through March 2023) and get approved more quickly.
I heard that the county office is closed - what should I expect?
Most county offices are now open, but you don’t have to go in person to the CalFresh office to get benefits. After you apply online, all of your communication with the county can be over the phone or through the mail. You can even have your EBT card mailed to you.
Using and Keeping CalFresh
Can I use my EBT card online?
Great news! You can use your EBT card to purchase groceries online at Amazon and Walmart. Visit Amazon or Walmart to learn more about how it works. Unfortunately, you can't use CalFresh to pay for delivery. California is working to expand access to more grocery stores ⁠— check back for updates.
Do I need to tell the county if I recently moved?
You don’t need to report a change of address if you have temporarily moved due to the pandemic. If you know you will not return to your old address, you can call your county to let them know you have moved. You can find their contact information here.
How do I report changes to my income?
If your income has decreased or stopped, you can upload proof of income for the last 30 days through getcalfresh.org/docs. Your county will give you more information about when you have to report increases in income. If your income went up and you aren't sure if you need to report changes, you can call your county to get more information.
Do I need to submit renewal reports such as the SAR 7?
Yes, Semi-Annual Reports (SAR 7s) for CalFresh must be submitted six months after your application. For example: Your SAR 7 would be due in June if you applied for CalFresh in January (unless everyone in your household is 60+ or disabled). If you have questions about when your SAR 7 is due, call your county office.
Replace lost or damaged food
How do I replace my benefits?
You can request replacement benefits for food that
   * you bought using CalFresh
   * and you lost or had damaged in an emergency (fire, natural disaster, power outages, etc.)
Follow these steps:
   1. Download the form: Replacement or Disaster Supplement Affidavit (CF 303) [PDF, 95 KB] open_in_new

Administrative Law Judge rules in your favor, the County will give back to you any benefits that were cut.

• Get assistance from the County to register to vote.
• Report changes that you are not required to report, if it may increase your CalFresh benefits.

used to determine whether your household is eligible or continues to be eligible to participate in the CalFreshProgram.  We will verify this information through computer matching programs, including the Income andEarnings Verification System (IEVS).  This information will also be used to monitor compliance with programregulations and for program management.
(ii) This information may be disclosed to other Federal and State agencies for official examination, and to law
enforcement officials for the purpose of apprehending persons fleeing to avoid the law.
(iii) If a CalFresh claim arises against your household, the information on this application, including all SSNs,
may be referred to Federal and State agencies, as well as private claims collection agencies, for claims
collection action.
(iv) Providing the requested information including the SSN of each household member, is voluntary.  However,
failure to provide an SSN will result in the denial of CalFresh benefits to each individual failing to provide anSSN.  Any SSNs provided will be used and disclosed in the same manner as SSNs of eligible householdmembers.
The County may verify immigration status of household members applying for benefits by contacting the USCIS.  Information the County gets from these agencies may affect your eligibility and level of benefits.

CF 285 (8/21) REQUIRED FORM - SUBSTITUTES NOT PERMITTED PROGRAM RULES PAGE 3 Of 6Please take and keep for your recordsUse of Social Security Numbers (SSN)
Everyone applying for CalFresh benefits needs to provide a SSN, if they have one, or proof that they have applied 
for a SSN (such as a letter from the Social Security Office).  The County may deny CalFresh benefits for you or any member of your household who does not give us a SSN.  Some people do not have to give SSN’s to get help such as, victims of domestic abuse, crime prosecution witnesses, and trafficking victims.
Overissuance
This means you got more CalFresh benefits than you should have.  You will have to pay it back even if the County made an error or if it wasn’t on purpose.  Your benefits may be lowered or stopped.  Your SSN may be used to collect the amount of benefits owed, through the courts, other collection agencies, or federal government collection action.
Reporting
Every household that gets CalFresh benefits must report certain changes.  Your County will tell you what changes to report, how to report them, and when to report them.  Failure to report the changes may result in your CalFresh benefits being lowered or stopped.  You can also report if things happen that may increase your benefits, such as getting less income.
State Hearing
You have the right to a State hearing if you do not agree with any action taken regarding your application or your ongoing benefits.  You can request a State hearing within 90 days of the County’s action and you must tell why you want a hearing.  The approval or denial notice you receive from the County will have information on how to request a State hearing.  If you ask for a hearing before the action happens, you may be able to keep your CalFresh benefits the same until a decision is made.

How many resources a household can have
   * Resource limitations
   * Resources of a sponsored non-citizens
Resource limitations
The resource rules in California’s SNAP program, called CalFresh, differ dramatically from other states adhering more closely to the regular federal SNAP resource rules. See the section of this Guide about how California has all but removed resource limitations for more specific information and regulatory citations, as well as the section about understanding categorical eligibility for additional related information.
In California, if the household includes one or more elderly or disabled members, or the household income is under 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, there is no resource limit.  [ACL 13-32, 14-56.]  This means that almost no CalFresh applicants or recipients have a resource limit.  Households with one or more elderly or disabled member and income over 200% of the Federal Poverty Level are subject to the resource limit.  [See ACL 23-60.]  In addition, the household is subject to the resource limit are where it has been disqualified because of an intentional program violation, a failure to submit a semi-annual report (SAR 7), had been sanctioned, or some other specific compliance requirement; or there is a disputed claim for benefits paid in the past, prior to the effective date of the newer rules about categorical and modified categorical eligibility put in place in 2009 and 2011.  [See ACL 23-60.]
Where applicable, the standard resource limit as $2,750. [ACIN I-48-23.] For aged/disabled households the resource level is now $4,250. [ACIN I-48-23; see also 7 C.F.R. § 273.8(b).] If a household goes over the applicable limit in countable resources, it will not be eligible for SNAP benefits, even if very low income. A corollary to this rule is that, should a household have resources below the resource limits, the resource amount does not affect how many SNAP benefits the household receive.
There are several types of property excluded as a resource and therefore not counted at all against the applcable resource limit.
In determining the value of a resource, the SNAP program only counts the equity value of property. This is the fair market value minus any loans owed on the resource. [MPP § 63-501.1; 7 C.F.R. § 273.8(c)(2).] If the household presents evidence that a resource cannot readily be converted into cash, the county has the burden of demonstating factually that the resource could have been readily converted. If the resource could not be converted, it simply is not counted.
The resources of people who are not in the CalFresh household are not counted against the household. (See the section about how to count the resources of people who cannot get CalFresh benefits.) That said, some people, like those subject to a work-requirement sanction or a penalty for an intentional program violation, who are a fleeing felon or have violated probation, who are ineligible immigrants, or who are disqualified for not providing a Social Security Number, have their resources still count. [MPP § 63-503.441 and .442; 7 C.F.R. § 273.8(i).]
Others, such as ineligible students,  do not get food benefits, yet also have their resources excluded. [MPP § 63-402.22.]  Roomers, boarders and foster children, either can be in or out of the household, depending on the decision of the head of household to include them or not. If they are included, their income and resources are counted like everyone else in the household; if not, neither their income nor resources count. [MPP § 63-402.21 and 63-402.321-.322; 7 C.F.R. § 273.8(i).]
Resources of sponsored non-citizens
If the household is subject to an applicable resource limit, there are special rules for households with a sponsored non-citizen. If the immigrant is considered indigent, then only resources actually provided would be counted. [See ACL 11-06; ACL 11-06E (continuation).] For sponsored immigrant households, the value of the sponsor’s resources over $1,500 are “deemed” or counted against the household’s resource limit. [MPP § 63-503.493(b)(1); 7 C.F.R. § 273.4(c)(2)(iv).] If the sponsor has sponsored other non-citizens, then the deemed resource is pro-rated, by dividing the fair-market value of the resource (over $1500) by the number of sponsored non-citizens. [MPP § 63-503.493(b), (c); 7 C.F.R. § 273.4(c)(3)(v).]
If the immigrant is considered indigent, then only resources actually provided are counted. [See ACL 11-06; ACL 11-06E (continuation).]  This is called the indigence exception to sponsor deeming.  The indigence exception applies when the adult noncitizen is unable to obtain food and shelter.  “Unable to obtain food and shelter” means the sum of (1) the eligible sponsored noncitizen household’s own current income, (2) the cash contributions actually received from the sponsor and others, plus (3) the value of any in-kind assistance the sponsor and others provide, does not exceed 130 percent of the federal poverty level for the household size.  [Id.]  The adult sponsored noncitizen is entitled to self-declare that s/he is indigent.  [Id.]  The indigence exception must be renewed every 12 months.  [Id.]  Sponsor deeming does not apply to children under age 18.  [Id.]
In addition, MPP § 63-503.492 and 7 C.F.R. § 273.4(c)(3) list the non-citizens exempted from sponsor deeming. These include:
   * Immigrants in the sponsor’s CalFresh household;
   * Immigrants sponsored by organizations or groups;
   * Immigrants not required to have sponsors (e.g., refugees, parolees, asylees and/or a Cuban or Haitian entrants); and
   * Immigrants who meet the indigency definition (i.e., with income below 130% of poverty).
This resource deeming continues until the immigrant becomes a citizen or works 40 qualifying quarters. [MPP § 63-503-491; 7 C.F.R. § 273.4(c)(2).]


How student aid is counted
Pell Grants (also known as Basic Education Opportunity Grants), federal and state college work study, and any other student financial aid from programs funded under Title IV of the federal Higher Education Act, the Bureau of Indian Affairs student assistance programs, or Title XIII of the Indian Higher Education Programs, are exempt income under the SNAP program. Receipt of such student aid will not reduce one’s CalFresh allotment. [7 CFR §§ 273.9(c)(3) and 273.9(c)(10); MPP § 63-502.2(q)(1)(A) and MPP § 63-507(a)(6); ACL 06-31 at 2; ACIN I-69-06; ACL 20-08, CalFresh Student Eligibility Handbook at p.6; see also 20 U.S.C. § 1087uu.]
In California, work study of any kind is exempt as income under MPP § 63-502.2(q)(1)(a). This particular CalFresh regulation cross-references the CalWORKs income exemptions, and CalWORKs exempts all work study as income, either under MPP § 44-111.24 or MPP 44-111.432(b)(7).
“Excluded” financial aid includes Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG), National Direct Student Loans (NDSL) (also known as Perkins Loans), Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL) (the same loan program that is the source of PLUS loans and Supplemental Loans for Students), the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program, Special Programs for Students from Disadvantaged Backgrounds (the source of TRIO loans), Special Programs for Students Whose Families are Engaged in Migrant and Seasonal Farm Work, Grants to States for State Student Incentives and the Income Contingent on Direct Loan Demonstration Project. [See 7 C.F.R. §§ 273.9(c)(3) and 273.9(c)(10); MPP § 63-507(a)(6).]
“Other educational assistance” — such as deferred payment loans, private grants, or private scholarships — is excluded only to the extent that it is earmarked by the lender, used for, or intended to be used for, “allowable educational expenses.” [7 CFR § 273.9(c)(3); MPP § 63-502.2(e); ACL 20-08, CalFresh Student Eligibility Handbook at p.6; ACIN I-01-24 at p.2.]
Under this category of “other educational assistance,” “allowable educational expenses” include: tuition and mandatory fees (including the purchase or rental of any equipment, materials, and supplies related to course of study), books, supplies, transportation, dependent care, and “miscellaneous personal expenses.” [7 CFR § 273.9(c)(3)(ii)(B) and 273.9(c)(9) MPP § 63-502.2(e)(2).] The definition of educational expenses, however, does not include everyday living expenses, such as rent or mortgage, personal clothing, or food eaten at home. [7 CFR § 273.9(c)(3)(ii)(B); MPP § 63-502.2(e)(2).]
Students must verify and document their allowable educational expenses. [MPP § 63-502.2(e)(4).] They should make sure that their CalFresh benefits are not being incorrectly reduced because the county has not taken into account that the financial aid was used for, or intended to be used for, educational expenses.

The Application Process:
What does the application process look like?
You can complete a CalFresh application at your local county office or online at benefitscal.org. To learn where you can apply in-person in your county (or to find places that can help you fill out an application), please use our Find Food Assistance tool.
 
Does it cost money to apply for CalFresh?
No. Applying for CalFresh is free and does not require a credit check.
 
Will I have to go into the CalFresh office? I live far away and don’t have transportation.
No. You can apply for and receive CalFresh benefits without ever going into the CalFresh office. In fact, many counties have organizations that can help people with their applications. See what is available in your county by using our Find Food Assistance tool.You can apply online at benefitscal.org, complete your interview over the phone, and have your EBT card mailed to you. 
 
How long will it take to know if I’ve been approved?
In most cases, the county has 30 days after you turn in your application to determine if you will get CalFresh (food stamps). During the 30 days, the county will interview you. The interview will be either over the phone or in person.
During the interview, the county will go over your application with you. The county may ask you for proof of income and certain costs (for example, child care or rent receipts). You will have 10 days to turn in these items.
The county may grant a household CalFresh benefits in three days if the household qualifies for “expedited service.” A household qualifies for expedited service if it
   * Has less than $150 in monthly income and less than $100 in liquid resources (cash, savings, or checking); or
   * Has housing costs that are more than its monthly income and liquid resources; or
   * Is a migrant or seasonal farm worker who is destitute.
 
What information will I need when to apply?
The county may ask you for “verifications,” or proof of your income and costs. Here are some examples of items the county may ask you for:
   * Proof of identity (examples: drivers license or identification card, passport, work or school ID, birth certificate, voter registration card)
   * Proof of where you live (examples: drivers license or ID card, utility bill, rent receipt)
   * Proof of income (examples: pay stubs, statement from employer, alimony check, award letter for unemployment or disability benefits )
   * Social security numbers for everyone who is applying
   * Proof of shelter costs (examples: housing bills, utility bills, HOA fees, property tax statement)
   * Child support court order
   * Child or adult care costs (example: bills)
   * Proof of disability (example: award letter)
   * Proof of medical costs if 60+ or disabled (examples: receipts for prescriptions, copay, service animal costs, glasses, hearing aids)
Even if you do not have everything on the list, you should still apply. The county may be able to help you get the information.
 
Will I have to get fingerprinted?
If you are only applying for CalFresh you will not be fingerprinted. If you are applying for another program you may be fingerprinted.
 
How much will I get each month?
The amount of CalFresh you get depends on many things, including your household’s size, income, and costs. The average CalFresh household gets over $300 each month (source). This chart shows the maximum benefit amounts at each household size: 
Using CalFresh:
If I get CalFresh am I taking benefits away from other people?
Everyone who qualifies for CalFresh will get benefits. In California, there are about 4 million people who are eligible but not receiving CalFresh. For every $5 of CalFresh spent in a community, another $9 of local economic activity is generated. This helps support jobs and businesses in your community.
 
How do I use my CalFresh benefits?
CalFresh benefits are issued on an EBT card that works like a debit card. You can use it at most grocery stores and many farmers markets.
Find stores and farmers markets in your area that accept CalFresh.
CalFresh can be used to buy food like
   * Fruits and vegetables;
   * Beans, fish, poultry, meat;
   * Rice, bread, tortillas, cereal;
   * Milk and cheese; and
   * Seeds and plants that produce food.
 
CalFresh cannot be used to buy
   * Alcohol, tobacco, cigarettes;
   * Non-food items (pet food, toilet paper, diapers, soap, etc.);
   * Vitamins and medicine;
   * Foods that will be eaten in the store; and
   * Hot foods (unless your county participates in the Restaurant Meals Program).
 
Will I have to pay back the benefits?
You will not have to pay back any benefits you were eligible to receive. If there is a mistake and you receive more than you are eligible for, you will be responsible for paying that amount back.

Other:
I just moved to another city in California. Who should I tell so that I keep getting CalFresh?
If you moved to a city in the same county you lived in before, update your address with the CalFresh office right away. This will ensure you will still get important notices about your CalFresh. If you moved to a city in a different county, contact the CalFresh office in your new county right away and request an Inter-County Transfer. The county can transfer your case and you should not have to reapply.

Income Tests
Gross/Net Income Tests [63-503.321, 63-301.6]
Households may be required to pass one or both of the following income tests to qualify for benefits:
      * Gross Income (130%) /test
      * NMI Test
Both tests are computed prospectively for the issuance period using reasonably certain income that is expected to be received in that certification period.
Separate Household Test for Elderly and Disabled Person [63-402.16, 63-1101.10]
An individual who is 60 years of age or older and his/her spouse who are living with others, may be a separate household if the individual is unable to purchase and prepare meals separately because he/she suffers from:
      * A disability considered permanent under the Social Security Act; or
      * A non-disease-related, severe, permanent disability (for example, injuries from a car accident), AND
      * The total nonexempt gross income of the others with whom the individual lives (excluding the income of the individual's spouse) does not exceed 165% of the federal income poverty guidelines. [Refer to the Chart Book “Elderly and Disabled Separate Household Test Limit,” page 1-1.]
This test is not automated. EWs must complete a manual budget. It does not have to be completed monthly, but should be completed:
      * At application.
      * At recertification.
      * When household composition changes.
      * When the household reports a change in the income of the other people in the home.
This test is applied to total gross income of others with whom a disabled elderly person and spouse live when the disabled elderly person is unable to purchase and prepare meals separately due to disability.
If the income of the others in the home is below the limit, the elderly and disabled person and spouse may be considered a separate household. Refer to Charts, Tables, and Miscellaneous.

	Gross Income (130%) Test for Change Reporting Households [63-502.1, 63-503.32, 63-1101.7]
[Refer to the Chart Book “Gross/Net Income Test Limits,” page 1-1 for the Gross Income (130%) Test Limits.]
This test is calculated prospectively based on the actual gross income anticipated for the Issuance Month. Follow the chart below to apply the Gross Income Test.
      1. Determine that the household does not contain an elderly/ disabled household member. (If it does, the Gross Income Test does not apply.)
      2. Determine the estimated and/or anticipated income for the Issuance Month.
      3. Add the following income if it is reasonably certain to be received in the issuance month:
      * Gross nonexempt earned and unearned income of all CF household members, (minus any legally obligated paid child support. Refer to Child Support [63-502(p)].
      * The household's PRORATED share of income from members excluded for failure to provide an SSN, or as an ineligible noncitizen or ineligible ABAWD.
      * ALL income from members excluded for committing an IPV, being disqualified due to failure to meet work requirements or being a fleeing felon, drug felon, or parole/probation violator.
      4. Round the household's total gross income:
      * Up if cents equal 50-90 cents.
      * Down if cents equal 0-49 cents.
      5. Compare this sum to the Maximum Gross Income “Chart” [Refer to the Chart Book “Chart,” page 1-1]. Is gross income at or below the limit for the appropriate household size?
      * If YES, the household passes the Gross Income Test. Now apply the Net Monthly Income Test.
      * If NO, the household is ineligible based on excess income. Send a denial NOA.
Gross Income (130%) Test for Semi-Annual Reporting (SAR) Households [63-503.32]
[Refer to the Chart Book “Gross/Net Income Test Limits,” page 1-1 for the Gross Income (130%) Test Limits.]
This test is calculated prospectively based on the actual gross income anticipated for the Payment Period. Follow the chart below to apply the Gross Income Test.
      1. Determine that the household does not contain an elderly/disabled household member. (If it does, the Gross Income Test does not apply.)
      2. Determine the estimated averaged income for the SAR Payment Period. To do so, add the following income if it is reasonably certain to be received during the SAR Payment Period.
      * Gross nonexempt earned and unearned income of all household members, minus any legally obligated paid child support. Refer to Child Support [63-502(p)].
      * The household’s PRORATED share of income from members excluded for failure to provide a SSN, being an ineligible noncitizen or ineligible ABAWD for each month of the SAR period.
      * ALL income from members excluded for committing an IPV, being work requirement disqualified, being a fleeing felon, drug felon, or parole/probation violator for each month of the SAR Period.
      3. REMINDERS: 
      * For stable income received weekly, multiply by 4.33 and for stable income received biweekly, multiply by 2.167.
      * For fluctuating income, use any additional routine paychecks (3rd check for those paid biweekly and 5th check for those paid weekly) that will be received during the SAR Period.
      * For self-employment income, use the net amount (i.e. the amount after the 40% standard deduction or actual business expenses have been deducted).
      4. Round the household's total gross income:
      * Up if cents equal 50-90 cents.
      * Down if cents equal 0-49 cents.
      5. Compare this sum to the Maximum Gross Income “Chart” [Refer to the Chart Book “Chart,” page 1-1]. Is gross income at or below the limit for the appropriate household size?
      * If YES, the household passes the Gross Income Test. Now apply the Net Monthly Income Test.
      * If NO, the household is ineligible based on excess income. Send a denial notice of action (NOA).
Net Monthly Income Test for Change Reporting Households [63-503.31, 63-1101.6]
[Refer to the Chart Book “Gross/Net Income Test Limits,” page 1-1 for the Net Monthly Income Test Limits.]
This test is calculated prospectively based on the net nonexempt income of all household members which can be reasonably anticipated for the issuance month. Follow the steps below to apply the Net Monthly Income Test.
      1. Calculate the household's net monthly income using income that is reasonably certain to be received in the issuance month. Follow the “CalFresh Budget Worksheet” (DFA 285B), or “CalFresh Budget Worksheet Special Medical/Shelter Deductions” (DFA 285D) if the household contains an elderly/disabled member. Count:
      * Gross nonexempt earned and unearned income of all household members.
      * The household's prorated share of income from members excluded for ineligible noncitizen status, ineligible ABAWD status or failure to provide an SSN.
      * ALL income from members excluded for committing an IPV, being work requirement disqualified, or being a fleeing felon, drug felon, or parole/ probation violator.
      * An additional routine paycheck (3rd check for those paid biweekly and 5th check for those paid weekly).
      * Excess medical expenses and unlimited excess shelter and dependent care deductions if the household contains an elderly/disabled member.
      2. Round the household's total net monthly income:
      * Up if cents equal 50-99 cents.
      * Down if cents equal 0-49 cents.
      3. Compare the household's net monthly income to the Net Monthly Income “Chart” [Refer to the Chart Book “Chart,” page 1-1]. Is net monthly income at or below the limit for the appropriate household size?
      * If YES, the household passes the Net Monthly Income Test. Enter the net income determined above into the computer to determine benefits.
      * IF NO, deny/discontinue the household because it does not pass the Net Monthly Income Test.
Net Monthly Income Test for Semi-Annual Reporting Households [63-503.32, 63-1101.6]
[Refer to the Chart Book “Gross/Net Income Test Limits,” page 1-1 for the Net Monthly Income Test Limits.]
This test is calculated prospectively based on the net nonexempt income of all household members which can be reasonably anticipated for the Payment Period. Follow the steps below to apply the Net Monthly Income Test
      1. Calculate the household's averaged net monthly income using income that is reasonably certain to be received in the issuance month. Follow the “CalFresh Budget Worksheet” (SAR 285B), in computing the net monthly income. 
      * Add the following income if it is reasonably certain to be received during the payment period.
      * Gross nonexempt earned and unearned income of all household members for each month.
      * The household's PRORATED share of income from members excluded for ineligible noncitizen status, ineligible ABAWD status or failure to provide an SSN.
      * ALL income from members excluded for committing an IPV, being work requirement disqualified, being a fleeing felon, drug felon, or parole/probation violator for each month.
      * For medical, child care and child care expenses, average the reasonably anticipated expenses over the certification period. To do so,
      * Add the amount anticipated for each month of the certification period.
      * Divide the total amount by the months in the certification period and use this averaged amount in the CalFresh budget.
      * REMINDERS:
      * For stable income received weekly, multiply by 4.33 and for stable income received biweekly, multiply by 2.167.
      * For fluctuating income, use any additional routine paycheck (3rd check for those paid biweekly and 5th check for those paid weekly) that will be received during the certification.
      * For self-employment income, use the net amount (i.e. the amount after the 40% standard deduction or actual business expenses have been deducted).
      * Allow excess medical expenses and unlimited excess shelter if the household contains an elderly/ disabled member.
      2. Round the household's total net monthly income:
      * Up if cents equal 50-99 cents.
      * Down if cents equal 0-49 cents.
      3. Compare the household's net monthly income to the Net Monthly Income “Chart” [Refer to the Chart Book “Chart,” page 1-1]. Is net monthly income at or below the limit for the appropriate household size?
      * If YES, the household passes the Net Monthly Income Test. Enter the averaged gross income and averaged expenses determined above into the computer to determine benefits.
      * IF NO, deny/discontinue the household because it does not pass the Net Monthly Income Test.
Zero Benefits
It is possible for a household to pass both tests but have a Net Monthly Income at a level for which benefits are not issued. Such a household is not eligible, and receives the same notice of action generated for a household failing the Gross Income (130%) or Net Monthly Income Tests.

ABAWD Exemptions Defined
Residing in a CalFresh Household with a CalFresh Household Member under the age of 18
Individuals who reside in a CalFresh household with a CalFresh household member under age 18 are exempt from the time limit.
      * The individual is not required to be the parent of the child.
      * The individual is not required to be responsible for the child.
      * The child can be an ineligible member of the CalFresh household for any reason.
      * The child can be temporarily absent from the home (no longer than 30 days).
Note: For the purpose of an ABAWD exemption, household strictly means the CalFresh household. The term household does not mean a group residing in the same physical structure. The phrase “the child can be an ineligible member of the CalFresh household for any reason” refers to a minor who would be a member of the CalFresh household but who is ineligible to participate in CalFresh (e.g., an ineligible non-citizen child or SSI recipient child, or failure to provide an SSN).
Example - Scenario One
Example - Scenario Two
Pregnancy
Individuals at any stage of pregnancy are exempt from the time limit. The exemption shall be effective beginning the month of conception and shall apply until, including the month of the child’s birth or until the individual is no longer pregnant. The client statement is sufficient as verification unless it is questionable. An individual must be allowed 10 days to provide verification if required.
Example
Exempt from CalFresh Work Registration Requirements
Individuals exempt from CalFresh work registration requirements are exempt from the time limit. ABAWDs that are not exempt from CalFresh work registration requirements may need to satisfy the ABAWD work requirement. The term “may” is used because an individual not exempt from work registration may be exempt from the ABAWD time limit for other reasons.
ABAWDs subject to the time limit must meet the CalFresh work registration requirements, such as registering for work and not voluntarily quitting a job of 30 hours per week or more without good cause, as well as the ABAWD work requirements.
Individuals who work a minimum of 30 hours per week or who are earning weekly wages at least equal to the Federal minimum wage multiplied by 30 hours (e.g., $7.25 x 30 hrs=$217.50/week) are exempt from CalFresh work registration and are therefore exempt from the ABAWD time limit.
Note: Due to California’s high minimum wage, individuals may be working much less than 30 hours as long as they make $217.50 per week.
For more information, refer to CalFresh Work Registration.
Physically or Mentally Unfit to Work
This exemption is a broader exemption than being disabled. An individual is considered medically certified as physically or mentally unfit to work if they have a temporary or permanent illness, disability, condition, or life circumstance that reduces or affects their ability to work 20 hours per week.
The definition of physically or mentally unfit to work to exempt an individual from the ABAWD time limit is not as limited as the definition of disability used to determine CalFresh eligibility or work registration.
The physical or mental condition must make an individual unable to work 20 hours per week on an ongoing basis, not unable to work at all. This includes individuals who might be able to work a few hours per week but cannot work half-time to full-time. An individual is considered physically or mentally unfit for work if they meet any of the following criteria:
Applied for/Receiving Temporary or Permanent Public or Private Disability Benefits
Individuals who have applied for or receive temporary or permanent public or private disability benefits are exempt from the ABAWD time limit. An individual may provide proof of receipt or pending application for temporary or permanent disability benefits from governmental or private sources, including but not limited to:
      * Veteran’s disability benefits (any rating of disability)
      * Workers compensation
      * Supplemental Security Income
      * State-issued temporary or permanent disability benefits
Important: An individual receiving any disability benefit from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is unfit to work for the purpose of exempting an individual from the ABAWD time limit. The VA assigns a percentage disability rating, but recipients with any rating meet the threshold for exemption from the time limit.
Note: There is no need to request additional client verification if information regarding the application or receipt of the disability benefit is known to the county. If this information is unknown to the county, the county may request proof of receipt or pending application for disability benefits. The CW 2200 may be used to request verification, and the individual must be allowed 10 days to provide the necessary verification if required.
Obviously Unfit to Work
Individuals mentally or physically unfit to work are exempt from the ABAWD time limit. The county must determine if an individual meets the definition of obviously unfit to work. This determination may be made when the individual attends a face-to-face or telephone interview.
To determine that an individual is obviously unfit to work, the county must conduct an individualized evaluation of the client. A discussion of the individual’s inability to work or participate in work activities for more than 20 hours per week on an ongoing basis is required to make the determination. The discussion should focus on the physical and/or mental challenges that affect or impact the individual’s ability to work.
Note: When an individual’s unfitness for work is evident to the EW, the county must exempt the individual without requiring a statement or verification from medical personnel. When the reason for the unfitness is apparent, adequate documentation in the case record by the EW is required to support the determination; no further verification is required.
Victims of Domestic Violence
An experience of domestic violence may indicate that an individual is obviously unfit to work. The EW may identify someone as obviously unfit for work if they are a victim of domestic violence. A victim of domestic violence is defined as an individual fleeing from any type of assault, coercive, or battering behavior occurring within a domestic relationship. Additionally, an individual who indicates that they are residing in or is on a waiting list to reside in a domestic violence shelter shall be considered to be escaping domestic violence and is exempt from the ABAWD time limit.
Domestic violence behavior includes, but is not limited to, one or more of the following:
      * Physical abuse
      * Sexual abuse
      * Psychological, emotional, and verbal abuse
      * Intimidation, threats, or behavior that puts the individual in fear of their safety
      * Isolation
      * Economic control
      * Stalking
      * Neglect or deprivation of medical care
      * Destruction of property or pets
A domestic relationship is defined as:
      * Adults or minors who are current or former spouses
      * Adults or minors who live together or have lived together
      * Adults or minors who are dating or have dated
      * Adults or minors who are engaged in or have engaged in sexual relations
      * Adults or minors who are related by blood or adoption
      * Adults or minors who are related or formerly related by marriage
      * Persons who have a child in common
      * Adults or minors who are engaged or were formerly engaged to be married
      * Adults or minors engaged in same-sex relationships
      * Adults or minor children of persons listed above
      * Adults or minors acting in concert with or on behalf of someone identified above
Example
Note: The county must evaluate the individual’s circumstances to determine if they are a victim of domestic violence. Counties may accept client statements for those individuals who inform the county they are a victim of domestic violence in person, by phone, or in writing. Counties may also accept a written statement, which a medical or mental health professional completes.
A police report is also adequate proof of an individual experiencing domestic violence unless questionable. The verbal statement of a medical or mental health professional may suffice as verification so long as the county adequately documents the case record. Client statement is acceptable verification if no other verification source is available.
Verification
The EW must evaluate the individual’s circumstance to determine if an obvious physical or mental unfitness is associated with drug or alcohol addiction that prevents them from working at least 20 hours per week or 80 hours on average monthly.
EW’s observation is the only required verification when the reason for the unfitness is apparent. The EW must not list domestic violence as the reason for the exemption. The EW must notate “Unfit for work due to medical reasons” in the case comment. This narration is adequate for unfitness to work related to either a physical or mental health reason.
If the unfitness is not apparent to the EW, the CW 2200 must be used to request verification, and the individual must be allowed 10 days to provide the necessary verification.
Example - Obviously Unfit to Work (Telephonic Determination)
Example - Obviously Unfit to Work (In-Person Determination)
Determined Physically or Mentally Unfit to Work by Medical Personnel
If the EW determines that an individual is not obviously unfit to work, but there may be a medically certified reason for the unfitness, the EW may request the individual provide medical certification of the unfitness, including the anticipated duration. The EW must explain to the person how they can provide verification of their condition or circumstance and assist if necessary.
Qualified medical or mental health professionals include, but are not limited to, any of the following: audiologist, dentist, designated representative of the physician’s office, drug and/or alcohol counselor, mental health counselor, midwife, nurse, nurse practitioner, occupational therapist, optometrist, orthodontist, osteopath, psychologist, physical therapist, physician, physician’s assistant, podiatrist, social worker, etc.
Acceptable verifications are as follows:
      * A written statement, such as a completed CalFresh Request for Medical/Mental Health Verification form, completed by the medical or mental health professional is adequate proof of a physical or mental health condition, unless questionable.
      * Similar documentation for another program (e.g., Medi-Cal, General Relief, etc.) included in the case record may also be utilized as verification.
      * A verbal statement of a medical or mental health professional may suffice as verification as long as the county properly documents that verbal verification was provided in the case record.
      * If written or verbal verification from a medical or mental health professional is unavailable or insufficient, the EW must make every attempt to verify unfitness to work using an acceptable collateral contact.
The CW 2200 may be used to request verification, and the individual must be allowed 10 days to provide the necessary verification if required.
Example
Case Documentation Examples for Physically or mentally unfit to work
Example 1
Example 2
Example 3
Participating in an Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) Training Program
Participation in an ORR training program for at least half-time exempts an individual (not only Cuban/Haitian entrants and refugees) from the ABAWD time limit as long as the person participating in the ORR program is otherwise eligible for CalFresh. The CW 2200 may be used to request verification, and the individual must be allowed 10 days to provide the necessary verification if required.
Acceptable verifications are:
      * Documentary evidence or written statements from the ORR training program are sufficient verification.
      * Collateral contact was made with an ORR training program staff member.
Example
Note: A collateral contact is an oral confirmation of a household's circumstances by a person outside the household. The collateral contact may be made either in person or over the telephone. The county may select a collateral contact if the household fails to designate a person, or the designated one is unacceptable to the county agency. Examples of acceptable collateral contacts may include employers, landlords, social service agencies, migrant service agencies, and neighbors of the household who can be expected to provide accurate third-party verification. When talking with collateral contacts, the EW should disclose information necessary to get the information being sought. The county should avoid disclosing that the household has applied for CalFresh, nor should the EW disclose any information supplied by the household confidential information, or suggest that the household is suspected of any wrong doing.
New ABAWD Time Limit Exemptions under the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) 2023
The federal law now provides temporary exemption criteria from the ABAWD time limit for three new groups of individuals, which will expire on October 1, 2030. 
 
1. Individuals experiencing homelessness
A homeless individual is an individual who lacks a fixed and regular nighttime residence or an individual whose primary nighttime residence is: 
      * A supervised shelter designed to provide temporary accommodations (such as a welfare hotel or congregate shelter);
      * A halfway house or similar institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized;
      * A temporary accommodation for not more than 90 days in the residence of another individual; or
      * A place not designed for, or ordinarily used, as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings (a hallway, a bus station, a lobby, or similar places).
 
For CalFresh,  individuals meet the homelessness criteria if: 
      * The homeless individual is coded as living in a homeless shelter and/or identifies the address of that shelter or homeless day program as their residential or mailing address for CalFresh purposes.
      * The homeless individual is coded as receiving the “Homeless Shelter Deduction” in their CalFresh benefit calculation.
      * The homeless individual has been determined eligible for the RMP.

Refer to Homeless Households for more information.
The FRA no longer requires verification of chronic homelessness indicators to meet the homeless definition, and no further assessment is necessary.
 
2. Veterans
Individuals who served in the United States Armed Forces, including those discharged from the reserve component of the Armed Forces, are exempt from the ABAWD time limit, regardless of their discharge status.
 
3. Foster Youth
Individuals aged 24 or younger who were in care on their 18th birthday, whether they continue in care or not, are exempt from the ABAWD time limit.  This includes any individual who was in a Foster care program run by the State, District, territory, or Indian Tribal Organization on their 18th birthday or a higher age allowed by the State. 
 
Example A:
A 19-year-old applicant/recipient in foster care on their 18th birthday who elects to remain in Extended Foster care qualifies for the exemption.

Example B:
A 21-year-old applicant/recipient who was in Foster care on their 18th birthday and did not elect to remain in extended foster care can still qualify for the exemption because they were in foster care when they turned 18. The individual would continue to be eligible for the exemption until their 25th birthday. 
Length of Exemptions: Permanent vs. Temporary
Long-term or Permanent Exemption
When the condition or life circumstance that qualifies an individual for an exemption is expected to be long-term or permanent, the individual can be exempt from the ABAWD time limit through the length of their certification period.
Temporary Exemption
When the condition or life circumstance that qualifies an individual for an exemption is considered temporary, the individual can be exempt until their next periodic report (i.e., SAR 7) or recertification, whichever occurs first, unless verification is received that specifies an expected end date for the exemption reason (which may be before the next periodic report or recertification).
Temporary Exemption with an End Date
If a temporary exemption ends during the certification period, the individual will become subject to the ABAWD time limit unless the individual satisfies the work requirement, becomes otherwise exempt, is granted a percentage exemption, or lives in a county or area where the ABAWD time limit has been waived.
The month in which an exemption ends shall not be considered a countable month if the individual was exempt for any part of the month.

Work rules and requirements
         * Summary of basic work requirements
         * Registering for work
         * CalFresh Employment and Training programs
         * Workfare
         * Accepting a referral or offer of suitable employment
         * Voluntary quit or reducing work effort
         * Deferrals from work requirements
Summary of basic work requirements
33 counties have voluntary CalFresh Employment and Training Programs for fiscal year 2017.  Participation in these programs is currently voluntary.  No counties have mandatory Employment and Training Programs.  [See ACL 20-10.]  A recipient cannot be sanctioned for failure to participate except for a comparable disqualification for failure to comply with CalWORKS Welfare-to-Work requirements.  [See Non-compliance with a work requirement.]  Work registration requirements are:
         * Register for work at application, and every 12 months after initial registration.  Counties can take responsibility for the work registration process;
         * Participate in CalFresh Employment and Training (E&T) programs, if mandatorily assigned by the county;
         * Participate in any non-voluntary assigned workfare program;
         * Accept a referral or offer of suitable employment;
         * Not voluntarily quit, without good cause, a job of 30 or more hours a week, or reduce work effort to less than 30 hours a week.
[MPP § 63-407.1; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(a)(1).]
There are county penalties for work registrants who do not accept offers of employment. [ACIN I-01-13.] There are also sanctions for non-compliance with work requirements, and for voluntarily quitting a job, unless the individual has good cause.
Certain adults without minor children (so-called ABAWDs) have a very short, time-limited period for CalFresh assistance unless they are working or in a work program.  [See Work programs for people subject to ABAWD requirements.] However, if subject to these limits, there are specific rules for regaining eligibility for CalFresh benefits.
All household members subject to work requirements must be advised of available employment and training services.  [Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill) § 4005.]
Registering for work
The counties are responsible for the work registration process.  [CalFresh E & T Handbook 2022 at p.9.]  As part of the initial application and recertification interview, counties must determine which individuals in the household are work registrants. Everyone who gets CalFresh benefits must register for work at application and every 12 months thereafter unless they are exempt. [MPP § 63-407.1; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(a)(i); ACL 20-10.] In California, this is a seamless process that happens at application or recertification, or if a change occurs so that the recipient loses an exemption or deferral. The county registers the individual by entering them into the data system. There are no forms or other steps the applicant/recipient must take.  [ACIN I-01-13.]
People applying for expedited (emergency) CalFresh benefits must also register, but if the registration is questionable the county is not to delay issuing emergency CalFresh benefits to verify that fact. [MPP § 63-301.541(d); 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(4)(i)(B).] People who are in General Assistance (GA) work programs, public assistance or CalWORKs work programs, the Refugee Resettlement Program (RRP), the Unpaid Community Service and Work Experience program are considered registered for work. [MPP § 63-407.23-.24.]
The County is required to explain the work registration requirements. [MPP § 63-407.3.]
CalFresh Employment and Training programs
Enrollment and participation in the CalFresh Employment and Training (E & T) program are voluntary for eligible CalFresh recipients.  [CalFresh E & T Handbook 2022 at p.8; ACL 23-34.] CalFresh recipients are not required to enroll in the CalFresh Employment and Training Program to keep their CalFresh benefits.  [Id.]  Participants cannot be sanctioned for failure to participate in CalFresh Employment and Training or for not meeting program requirements if they do participate.  [Id.]
The California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has left it to county discretion whether the county will have an E&T program and to develop criteria for participation. [MPP § 63-407.8; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(e).] Counties are responsible for screening and referral of all CalFresh applicants and recipients to the CalFresh Employment and Training program as part of the certification process. [ACL 23-34.]  If an individual was not screened or referred to CalFresh employment and training during certification, the individual or the employment and training program can ask the county to complete a screening and referral.  [Id.] Under SB 43 (2011), a county that elects to participate in CalFresh E&T program, is required to screen CalFresh work registrants for deferrals. [See MPP § 63-407.811.]
Counties can create additional deferrals beyond those in the E&T regulations, such as a deferral based on homelessness. The additional bases for deferrals must be in the county E&T plan. If deferred, the person can still participate as a voluntary participant. Adding to the regular list of exemptions, SB 43 also includes deferrals based upon living in a “work surplus area” (read, “high unemployment area”).
Neither state nor federal regulation requires the county to make an E&T assignment. That said, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has clarified that, other than work registration, the state (and thus California counties) may operate the entire rest of their E&T program as a volunteer program.
In California, the following programs are included in CalFresh E&T:
         * Job search requirements
         * Job search training programs
         * Workfare (see below)
         * Work experience programs
         * Job training
         * Educational programs
         * Self-employment programs
         * Job search training
         * Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) activities
         * Self-employment training
         * Job retention for a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of 90 days.  [Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill) § 4005]
         * Subsidized employment
         * Apprenticeships [Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill) § 4005]
[See [MPP § 63-407.841‘ 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(f)(1)(i)-(vii); ACL 18-11; and CalFresh E & T Handbook 2022 at pp. 11-20.]
Beginning in fiscal year 2022, counties that are providing CalFresh E & T services can offer subsidized employment as a work experience activity.  This means that wages can be paid to participants who engage in work experience and wage costs may be claimed as an allowable CalFresh E & T expense.  [ACL 21-48.]
E & T programs for veterans operated by the Department of Labor or the Department of Veterans Affairs and certified workforce partnerships are allowable work activities to satisfy the ABAWD work requirement.  [Id.]
Time spent in case management through E & T counts toward the ABAWD work requirement.  [Id.]
Cell-Ed online programs qualifies for CalFresh E & T time as education, supervised job search and vocational education.  [ACIN I-55-20.]   Cell-Ed participants can count 3 hours of homework time for each hour of time spent in a Cell-Ed course.  [ACWDL October 19, 2020.]
“Work experience” differs slightly from “workfare.” Work experience is intended to move participants “promptly” into regular public or private employment. The assignments are limited to “projects that serve a useful public purpose.” [MPP § 63-407.841(b)(2).]
Participation requirements are set out at MPP § 63-407.83. The county can either assign someone to either a voluntary or a mandatory CalFresh E&T program. Individuals who are deferred may volunteer, but are not mandatory participants, and therefore not subject to sanction. Also, ACL 12-03 added new “deferral” criteria. Mandatory programs are required to provide a minimum of 12 hours per month, limits on job search, and a “minimum wage limit” on unpaid work.
The minimum wage limit is calculated by dividing the amount of the household’s CalFresh allotment by the minimum wage, the result being the maximum number of E&T hours of unpaid work that can be imposed.
The failure to comply with E&T without good cause will cause the non-complying, mandatory participant losing her CalFresh benefits. There are no repercussions for people who do not comply with a voluntary E&T program. [MPP § 63-407.86; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(e)(3)(ii).]
Counties and state partners can purchase necessary equipment for use by CalFresh E & T participants.  Equipment purchased by a county, state partner, or third-party partner may include laptops, cell phones, and other computer equipment to be loaned to participants for programs that require remote access such as distance learning. [ACL 20-125.]
Supportive services assist participants with overcoming barriers that prevent participation in CalFresh E & T.  Providers are required to pay directly or reimburse CalFresh E & T participants for expenses that are reasonable, necessary and directly related to participation upon presentation of appropriate documentation.  Reimbursable supportive services include dependent care costs, transportation, uniforms, personal safety items, books or training materials, and internet or telephone services. [Id.]  Supportive services can also include housing stability services for recipients who are at risk of eviction of homelessness.  [ACWDL, January 14, 2021.]  Federal reimbursement for subsidized housing is limited to no more than two months per year.  [Id.]
The county is required to provide reimbursement (or advance pay) for the actual costs of transportation and other E&T participation expenses that are “reasonable and necessary” and directly related to participation in the E&T program. [MPP § 63-407.831; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(d)(1)(iv)(3).] The counties must have a written policy about these support services. [MPP § 63-407.831(a)(2).] Reimbursement can include mileage and parking.
Counties must pay or reimburse participants for the actual cost of transportation and other actual costs that are reasonable and necessary for participation. While they can cap the level of payment or reimbursement, any cap should be based on reasonable participation expenses and cannot be set at zero or capped at an amount that does not cover basic transportation or other necessary expenses.
In reimbursing dependent care, counties can use the lower of the actual cost of dependent care or the statewide limit established in accordance with the Child Care and Development Block Grant.
State agencies must reimburse applicants and volunteers for E&T participation expenses. Participants with expenses that exceed the state cap must be exempted from mandatory E&T participation. [7 C.F.R. § 273.7(d)(4)(v).] Recipients who are E&T workers are covered by workers compensation for Workfare, On-the-Job Training, and Work Experience assignment, through state coverage. [ACL 11-17.]
The 2018 Farm Bill provision requiring counties to consult with Local Workforce Development Boards when designing their E & T programs. Beginning in fiscal year 2022, counties may consult with private employers or employee organizations instead of Local Workforce Development Boards if they can demonstrate it is more effective or efficient.  [ACL 21-48.]
Effective October 1, 2021, E & T providers can make a determination that a participant is not a good fit for a particular E & T component.  If the providers makes this determination, the county must decide if the individual should continue to participate in E & T.  If the provider determines they have a more suitable placement, the county can either require the provider to refer to participant back to the county, or allow the provider to switch the individual to the other placement without a referral. [Id.]
When the county receives a determination that a participant is not a good fit, the county must, no later than the participants next recertification, either: refer the individual to another appropriate E & T component, refer the individual to a workforce partnership, reassess the physical and mental fitness of the individual, or coordinate with other workforce or assistance programs to identify other work opportunities or assistance. [Id.]
During COVID-19, consistent with public health guidance, personal protective equipment necessary to engage in CalFresh E & T, when not provided by an employer, is covered, including personal protective equipment, hard hats, non-slip shoes, cloth face coverings and protective gloves.  [ACL 20-125.]
All CalFresh E&T programs must provide case management services.  [CalFresh E & T Handbook 2022 at p.11.]  Case management may include comprehensive intake assessments, employability assessments, individualized service plans, progress monitoring, and coordination with service providers.
Workfare
Workfare is when a recipient has to work without pay in order to get CalFresh benefits or some other public assistance. Counties can offer workfare as a component of its E&T program. The USDA must approve in advance of any workfare program. [MPP § 63-407.91; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(m)(2)(iii).]
People assigned to workfare can be referred to work for a public or private, non-profit agency. [MPP § 63-407.91; 7 C.F.R. §§ 273.7 (m)(2)(iv) and 273.7(m)(3)(ii).] The county can run the workfare program itself or it can have some other public or private non-profit agency do so. [MPP § 63-407.91; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(m)(3)(ii).] The program is intended to provide participants with “an opportunity to develop basic work habits or to practice existing skills,” and to improve employability and enable individuals to move into regular employment. [See MPP § 63-407.841(b); 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(m).]
The number of workfare hours that can be assigned is limited by minimum wage. This is determined by dividing the household’s monthly CalFresh allotment by the state or local minimum wage or, if exempt from those laws, by the federal minimum wage. The highest applicable wage is used. [MPP §§ 63-407.24, 63-407.855; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(m)(5)(B)(ii).]
For example, if the household gets $400 per month in CalFresh benefits, at a current state minimum wage of $8 per hour, the workfare hours for the household would be limited to 50 hours ($400 / 8 = 50).
There are special provisions for determining how to credit work, or offset an “overissuance” when the person has performed workfare and an overissuance of benefits occurs. [MPP § 63-407.89; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(m)(6)(v).]
Accepting a referral or offer of suitable employment
All non-exempt recipients must follow through on any county referrals to potential suitable employment. They also must accept any offer of suitable employment. [MPP § 63-407.43; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(a)(1)(vi).] Suitability of referrals and employment is governed by MPP § 63-407.7; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(h).
Voluntary quit or reducing work effort
Unless exempt from work registration, CalFresh recipients may not, without good cause, voluntarily quit a job or reduce earning if the job is 30 or more hours a week, or the pay is equal to 30 hours at minimum wage. [MPP § 63-408.1; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(a)(1)(vii).] California imposes incremental penalties of one, three and six months, for first, second and subsequent voluntary quits. [MPP § 63-408.1; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(j)(1).]
If the “voluntary quit without good cause” occurred within 60 days of the application for CalFresh benefits, the county will deny the application for one, three, or six months. [MPP § 63-408.11; 7 C.F.R. § 273.7(j)(3).] The “quit” penalty is not imposed if the person quits, gets a new job and then subsequently loses the job through no fault of the recipient. [MPP § 63-408.112.] Ceasing self-employment is not considered a voluntary quit. [MPP § 63-408.111.]
“Good cause” includes:
         * Circumstances beyond the registrant’s control, such as illness, illness of another household member requiring the presence of the registrant, a household emergency, the unavailability of transportation, or problems caused by inability of the registrant to speak or write English;
         * Resigning from an unsuitable job (including one which illegally discriminates, imposes unreasonable work demands or schedules);
         * Acceptance by the individual of employment, or enrollment of at least half-time in any recognized school, training program or institution of higher education requiring the individual leave employment;
         * Acceptance by any other household member of employment or enrollment at least half-time in any recognized school, training program or institution of higher education in another county or state which requires the household to move, thereby requiring the work registrant to leave employment;
         * Resignations by persons under the age of 60 which are recognized by the employer as retirement;
         * Acceptance of a bona fide offer of employment of 30 hours or more a week or at the equivalent wage when, because of circumstances beyond the control of the individual, the job either does not materialize or results in fewer hours of employment;
         * Lack of adequate child care arrangements for a registrant’s children between six and 12 years old;
         * If the child is older than 13 but unable to be left alone because of an impairment or is under court supervision, the exemption would also apply since that is the standard for dependent care in CalFresh benefits.
[See MPP § 63-408.4.]
Deferrals from work requirements
Certain CalFresh recipients are deferred from work requirements, meaning they must register for work but are not required to participate.  Work registrants are deferred from participation if they are:
– Under age 18 or 50 years of age or older [ACL 12-03];
        – Living in a CalFresh household with a child under the age of 18, regardless of whether or not the child is receiving, or is eligible to receive, CalFresh benefits [ACL 12-03];
        – Living in a federally determined work surplus area;
        –  Lack of child care
        –  Lack of transportation
        –  Live an unreasonable distance from the work program site
       –  Have a severe family crisis
        – Veterans that have been honorably discharged from the United States Armed Forces [ACL 13-107];
        – Victims of domestic violence.  Self-attestation by a victim is sufficient to establish domestic violence unless the CWD documents independent evidence which strongly suggests that the individual’s statement is not credible [ACL 17-30].
        –  Individuals subject to the ABAWD time limit.  [ACL 18-11.]
[MPP § 63-407.811.]
Individuals who are deferred are reevaluated no later than at each recertification.  [MPP § 63-407.813.]  Individuals who are deferred can volunteer to participate.  [MPP § 63-407.814.]  Note that additional categories of recipients are exempt from work requirements, meaning they do not need to register for work.


Definition of “income”
The bottom line: It’s all about counting real income actually available to the household.
In order to receive CalFresh benefits, most households must have less income than the gross and net income limits. [7 U.S.C. § 2014; 7 C.F.R. § 273.9(a); MPP § 63-503.321(a)(QR).] The CalFresh office first will review a household’s total gross monthly income to determine if it is below the gross income limit, which is 130% of the federal poverty level. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.9(a), 273.10(e)(2)(i)(B); MPP § 63-503.326(QR).] If it is, the CalFresh office then will look at the household’s net monthly income — i.e., income after it subtracts some of the household’s expenses — to decide how much in CalFresh benefits the household will get. The household’s net income must be below 100% of the federal poverty level. [7 C.F.R. § 273.9(a)(2); MPP §63-503.322(a)(QR).]
Households in which at least one member is elderly or disabled do not have to meet the gross income test; they only have to meet the net income limit. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.9(a)(1); 273.10(e)(2)(i)(A).] California state regulation MPP § 63-503.323 incorrectly states that all household members must be elderly or disabled in order to be exempt from the gross income test. The California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has acknowledged that this is incorrect but has yet to publish a corrected state regulation. CDSS has issued separate CalFresh budget sheets for calculating benefits for households with an elderly or disabled member, but advocates should be alert that some counties may still be budgeting such households incorrectly.
The CalFresh office will want to know about all income that each person in the CalFresh household gets in the so-called “data month” (i.e., the second month of the quarter) and expects to get in the next quarter. (For a detailed explanation of how this works, see the section about semi-annual reporting.) The CalFresh household must provide this information. [MPP § 63-505.31 (QR).] This does not mean that the office will count all money that the household gets as income. [7 U.S.C. § 2014(d); 7 C.F.R. § 273.9(c); MPP §§ 63-502.12 and 63-502.2.]
Some income simply does not count. Except in cases where the Food and Nutrition Act clearly requires counting something as income, only income that is “actually available” to the household should be counted. See, e.g., Heckler v. Turner, 470 U.S. 184 (1985) (continued vitality of “actual availability” principle); Garcia v. Swoap, 63 Cal.App.3d 903 (1976), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 930 (1978). See also 7 C.F.R. § 273.9(b)(5); MPP § 63-502.12 (not counting as income the funds, specifically child support payments and funds withheld to repay overpayment, that are not actually available, even though no section of the Food and Nutrition Act provides specific exclusion).
There are situations where some income is only partially exempt, and the remainder counted. An example of this would be educational “financial aid,” some of which is entirely excluded and some of which is included as “unearned income” to the extent it is not used for educational expenses. [MPP § 63-502.2(e).] The CalFresh office should explain these rules. Another example would be child support paid directly to the household, which is treated as “unearned income” (but not so if assigned to the state, as it is for CalWORKs families). 7 C.F.R. § 273.9(b)(5)(ii). This includes the so-called “$50 pass through” given to CalWORKs families as an incentive to promote cooperation in paying child support. [MPP § 63-502.122.]
The CalFresh office also will want to know what income comes from working — so-called “earned income” — and what other “unearned income” the household gets for some other reason. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.9(b)(1) and (2); MPP § 63-502.112.] The CalFresh office deducts more expenses from earned income than it does from unearned income when it figures how many CalFresh benefits to give the households.
A household member who is out of the home and living with a military unit is not considered part of the CalFresh household. Any income or resources the military member actually provides to the household. however, is counted as income to the household. [MPP § 63-503.45.] More specifically, some military pay, such as combat pay, is not counted. [See, SNAP program letter regarding Extension of Food Stamp Exclusion (March 1, 2007); see also, ACL 05-04 (exclusion of income due to military deployment).] Many other payments, however, are treated as income. Typical payments treated as income are the “Family Self-Sufficiency Allowance” (FSSA), and the basic housing allowance for off-base housing. [See ACIN I-79-03EII for California state policy based on 7 CFR § 273.9(vii).]
IHSS wages are considered income for purposes of CalFresh.  [ACIN I-34-17.]  CDSS has taken the position that IHSS wages are not excluded as money received for care and maintenance of the third party who is not a household member because it is considered earned income, and the Internal Revenue Service rules excluding IHSS as a difficulty of care payment do not apply to CalFresh.  [Id.]
Benefits from the COVID-19 unemployment insurance programs, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Assistance and Pandemic Unemployment Compensation, count as income for CalFresh.  [ACWDL, April 21, 2020.]
Credit card company gift cards that are provided regularly and can be reasonably anticipated should be counted as income. [FNS Revised Treatment of Gift Cards in Determining SNAP.]
Earmarked income, that is, income received by the CalFresh applicant or recipient that is designated for a particular purpose, counts as income for CalFresh unless its source is otherwise excluded.  (ACIN I-01-24.) Earmarked income that is received only once, or that is so infrequent that it cannot be reasonably anticipated does not court for CalFresh purposes. [Id.]

         * Social Security number for Newborns
         * For related information, see the section about verifications required by the CalFresh program
The need for a Social Security number
To get CalFresh benefits you must have a Social Security number (SSN), or have applied for one, or have good cause for not applying for one. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(c); MPP § 63-404.1; ACL 24-44.]
All people in a household applying for CalFresh benefits must give the CalFresh office their SSNs. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(a), MPP § 63-404.1.] The county should not ask for SSN information for people in the household who are not seeking benefits for themselves.
For more details about household members who do not have SSNs, see the FNS memo, Tri-Agency Guidance and the FNS Policy Guidance Regarding Inquiries Into Citizenship, Immigration Status and Social Security Numbers.
The CalFresh office must check the SSNs of everyone in the household with the Social Security Administration (SSA). However, if the county has already checked a household’s SSN for a CalFresh, CalWORKS, or Medi-Cal application, then the CalFresh office does not need to check again. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(v); MPP § 63-404.62.] The CalFresh office cannot delay or deny CalFresh benefits while it waits to check a SSN. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(v); MPP § 63-404.63.]
If an applicant is not sure if they has a SSN, or cannot remember it, they can contact Social Security. He may need to reapply at a Social Security office for a SSN. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.6(c), (d); MPP §§ 63-404.31.]
Applications should be filed using the exact name associated with the Social Security Number.  This is true even when the applicant is incarcerated under an alias or other alternate name.  [ACWDL, November 18, 2022.]
Good cause to not apply for a Social Security number
Applicants without SSNs must apply for one before receiving benefits unless there is “good cause.” [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(b)(2); MPP § 63-404.31, 404.41.] “Good cause” means that the person tried to apply for a SSN but cannot, yet. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(d); MPP § 63-404.5; ACL 24-44.] For example, someone may have “good cause” if their Social Security office will not take his SSN application because he does not have proof of his age, and Social Security and must send away for his birth certificate.  CDSS says that delays because of illness, temporary absence or lack of transportation are not good cause.  [ACL 24-44.]
If the CalFresh office finds good cause for not trying to get a Social Security number, an applicant can get CalFresh benefits for one month in addition to the month of application. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(d); MPP § 63-404.52; ACL 24-44.] The CalFresh office will then decide if there is good cause for not applying for a SSN at the end of each month. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(d); MPP § 63-404.52.] Eventually, either the applicant will get a SSN, or lack good cause for not applying for one.
An otherwise eligible person should not be denied SNAP benefits for failure to provide a Social Security number where that failure was for reasons beyond their control. See, e.g., Cox v. Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, 480 So.2d 149, 150 (Fla.App. 1985).
Applying for a Social Security number
The county should provide an application for a SSN. An applicant should take the completed application to their local Social Security office. [MPP § 63-404.3.]
To get a SSN, a person needs to show her:
         * Identity;
         * Age; and
         * Citizenship status
Non-citizen applicants have to show proof of their immigration status. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(ii)(B).] Applications for SSNs may also be done by mail, but the county may require that proof also be mailed. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(d).] The county should assist applicants unable to obtain proof. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(d); MPP § 63-404.51.]
CDSS has developed a new form for request a non-work SSN, the Non-Work Social Security Number Request Form (GEN 2101). [ACL 24-44.]  Social Security will accept the new form.  A wet signature of an authorized county management official or designee is required.  [Id.]  Counties can develop their own form, but only the GEN 2101 has been approved by the Social Security Administration.  [Id.]
Going from a SSN application to CalFresh
A SSN applicant should get a receipt proving he turned the application in. Then, he should give a copy of the receipt to the CalFresh office. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(b)(2)(ii); MPP § 63-404.51.] The CalFresh program should arrange with SSA to be notified directly of when the SSN is issued.
Once the receipt is submitted, the CalFresh office will approve benefits while the application for the SSN is processed. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(d); MPP §§ 63-404.5, 404.34.] Once a person gets a SSN and the CalFresh office has the new SSN, benefits should be paid. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(b)(2)(ii); MPP § 63-404.34.]
Effect of having no Social Security number
If a household member fails to provide or apply for a SSN without a good cause, she will not receive benefits due to disqualification. [7 C.F.R. § 273.41; MPP §§ 63-404.11, 63-404.4.] This disqualification applies only to that individual member and not to the entire household. [Id.] The disqualified person’s income and resources can affect the entire household’s benefit allotment and eligibility. [MPP § 63-404.42.]
Disqualification for lacking a SSN can end. Once a disqualified household member provides the county with his SSN, proof of an SSN application, or good cause for why an SSN application cannot be completed, that member becomes eligible for benefits. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(e); MPP § 63-404.7.]
For applicants applying for emergency or expedited processing — a very common occurence — a SSN is not needed until after the first payment is made. Before the next benefit is paid, the household will have to provide its SSNs or evidence of applying for SSNs. [MPP § 63-404.2.]For CFAP, trafficking victims, crime victims, and domestic violence survivors are not required to have a SSN.  [ACL 24-44.]  When CFAP is expanded to all individuals over age 55 regardless of immigration status, applicants who do not have a SSN will be evaluated for eligibility based on all other criteria.  [Id.]
Social Security Number for Newborns
A newborn baby is exempt from this requirement for six months. If after 6 months the household is unable to provide a SSN or proof of applying for a SSN for a newborn, the County must determine if there is a good cause for non-compliance and, if good cause is found, approve an additional month’s benefit. The County must review information from multiple sources, including the family member and the Social Security Administration, and must accept documentary evidence of the SSN application.  [ACIN I-54-22.]
If the household cannot provide an SSN when they apply for CalFresh for the newborn, the child is eligible until the next recertification or six months after the application, whichever is later. If the recertification is earlier, the county must send the family a Request for Verification Form (CW 2200) six months after benefits are granted. [Id.] The family will have ten days to respond to the request for verification.  If the recertification is more than six months after benefits are granted, the county must request the child’s SSN during the recertification process.  If the household does not provide the child’s SSN, the child will be excluded from the CalFresh household unless there is good cause for the newborn not having a SSN.  [Id.]
A new baby must be added to the CalFresh program one month after verbal communication of the newborn and date of birth. Counties cannot require the household to complete an application form to add the newborn to the CalFresh household.  [Id.]


Verifications the CalFresh office requires
         * Things the applicant must prove
         * The County residency requirement
         * Optional verifications
         * Verification of job loss or zero income
         * For related information, see the sections about Social Security number requirements and how the CalFresh program verifies information
Things the applicant must prove
CalFresh offices should tell applicants clearly what verifiable information they must bring in, and the date by which they must bring in that information. [7 U.S.C. § 2020(e)(3); MPP § 63-300.37.] The CalFresh office should be flexible about what is acceptable verification. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(5)(i).] “In general, counties should verify only mandatory eligibility factors for CalFresh unless its for the purpose of maximizing benefits.” [ACIN 1-45-11]
SNAP regulations require applicants to give the case worker proof of 14 things.  [ACL 20-48.]
         1. Income. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(i); MPP § 63-300.5(e)(1).] The state should only “reverify” income at recertification if the household’s income has changed more than $50. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(8)(i)(A).] Some notable irregularities include situations where a household member’s name differs from the name on an earnings statement, and households with California Employment Development Department (EDD) debt cards. [See ACIN I-51-11.] (See the section about the definition of income for more details).  At application, households must provide verification of income earned over the last 30 days unless the household just started working.  Note that Excluded income is not subject to verification.  [ACIN I-01-24.] Counties can only request verification if the information provided by the applicant or recipient is questionable. [Id.]
         2. The immigration status of any non-U.S. citizen household member. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(ii); MPP § 63-300.5(e)(2).] The CalFresh office will send this information to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to be checked.
         3. The Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) only before the Standard Utility Allowance is allowable as a deduction from gross income. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(iii); MPP § 63-502.363; ACIN I-61-08.] See the section about income deductions for more details.
         4. Shelter costs only before shelter costs are allowable as a deduction from gross income.  [ACL 20-48.]
         5. The Social Security numbers of everyone in the household. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(v); MPP § 63-404.1.] The CalFresh office will check the numbers with the Social Security Administration (SSA). If a household member applying for benefits does not provide a Social Security number, that person must prove they applied for one. [7 C.F.R. § 273.6(b)(2); MPP § 63-404.3.]. See the section about Social Security number requirements for more details.
         6. Where the applicant lives. The CalFresh office does not have to verify where the applicant lives if it is not reasonably possible to get verification. [MPP § 63-300.5(e)(5).] For example, the county does not have to verify where the applicant lives if she just came to the area, if she is homeless, or if she is a migrant farm worker and cannot get verification easily. [MPP § 63-300.5(e)(5)(A).] Homeless people who live in a general area should simply have to show that they live in that area. They can verify this through someone who knows them, e.g., a letter from a collateral contact. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.3(a), 273.2(f)(1)(vi); MPP § 63-300.5(e)(5).]
         7. The identity of the person making the application for CalFresh benefits, i.e., the adult or head of household. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(vii); MPP § 63-300.5(e)(3).] If an authorized representative applies for the household, the CalFresh office must verify the identity of both the authorized representative and the head of the household. [Id.] If the person cannot prove identity through readily available documents — e.g., because they lack a photo ID — the county must use the collateral contact process.[Id.] Counties cannot limit verification to any single type of document if multiple sources are available. [ACIN 1-45-11.] If the household was already verified through the SSA for a Medi-Cal application, the household is considered verified for CalFresh. [Id.]
         8. Medical expenses, for households with an elderly or disabled member. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(iv); MPP § 63-300.5(e)(7).] The state shouild only “reverify” medical expenses at recertification if they have changed more than $50. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(8)(i)(A).] If the medical expense is not verified, the household does not get the deduction, but the failure to verify does not affect eligibility otherwise. (See the section about medical expense deductions for more information.)
         9. Disability benefits. If a member of the household wants the special benefits the CalFresh Program gives to disabled people, then she must prove she is getting disability benefits. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(viii); MPP § 63-300.5(e)(9).] (See the section about how “elderly” and “disabled” are defined for more information.)
         10. Child support payments. The household must show what amount it is legally obligated to pay, and what amount the household actually pays per month. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(5)(xii); MPP § 63-300.5(e)(10).] The household is responsible for providing verification. [MPP § 63-300.5(e)(10).] (For related information on verifying child support obligations and payments, see the first set of Questions and Answers Regarding the Food Stamp Program Certification Provisions of the 2002 Farm Bill.)
         11. Physical or mental “unfitness. This is only necessary if one individual in the household says she is a student not traditionally eligible for CalFresh benefits. This does not apply to those obviously “unfit.”; [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(xi).] A statement from a doctor or psychologist is OK. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(xi).; MPP § 63-406.121.]
         12. “ABAWD” recipients. Able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD) subject to the three-month time limit must verify the number of hours per week they are working or in a work program. An individual can also use the number of months of SNAP benefits he has received in another state to show that he is currently eligible for SNAP benefits. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(xiv); MPP § 63-410.2.]  See Able-bodied adults without dependants for the status of the ABAWD rule in your county and statewide.
         13. Sponsored non-citizen information only for a member of the household who is a sponsored non-citizen, who is applying for benefits, and who has not claimed to be indigent.  [ACL 20-48.]
         14. “Drug felony” compliance with drug treatment that is a condition of probation or parole. [ACL 20-48.] In states other than California, the so-called drug-felony exclusion may still apply. These states may require specific verifications related to current involvement in a drug treatment program and testing negative for drug use.
This drug-felony exclusion rule no longer applies in California. No person in a CalFresh household can be excluded from an assistance unit or otherwise be denied CalFresh or CalWORKs benefits because of a prior felony drug conviction. See ACL 14-100 (December 19, 2014) and ACL 14-92 (December 22, 2014) for more details about this rule change in the CalFresh program. However, people with a prior drug felony can be excluded if they are not participating in drug treatment as required by a condition of probation or parole.
Counties cannot require a specific type of verification even if the information is considered a mandatory. Verification can be provided by various methods including documentary evidence, electronic verification, collateral contact and client statement. When certain verification methods are unavailable to the household, the county must use the best available information.  [ACL 20-48.] For formerly incarcerated individuals, identification cards and booking sheets from the prison or jail are examples of acceptable forms of identification. [ACWDL, November 18, 2022.]  Any documents which reasonably establish the applicant’s identity must be accepted,  [Id.]
Counties must assist all households in obtaining mandatory verification. Counties must use existing verification sources when available, and electronic verification when applicable to the household.  [ACL 20-48; ACWDL, November 18, 2022.]
To the extent permitted by federal law, counties must seek verification via available electronic sources or client statement when allowed, before requiring submission of additional information, use of collateral contacts, or home visits.  Before sending a household request for missing verification, the county must check all available electronic resources to verify the missing information, and use the client statement to the extent allowed by federal law.  [ACL 20-135.]
Counties must not send a request for missing verification or deny a case based on missing verification, unless they have first checked all available electronic sources or determined whether client statement is an allowable option. [Id.]
Available electronic sources include IEVS, MEDS, SSA, CMIPS, or any other source available to the county.  The Work Number can only be used for verification when confirmed by the household to be accurate.  [Id.]
Counties must accept verbal confirmation from the household whenever client statement is a valid form of verification.  For information that can be verified by client statement and that is not questionable, counties are not required to also check electronic sources, and cannot delay processing of an application, recertification or periodic report by checking electronic resources.  [ACL 20-135.]  When regulations only allow for verification via client statement under specific circumstances, and all other attempts at verification have failed, counties can use the best available information which can include verbal client statement.  [Id.]  For information that can be verified via client statement and that is not questionable, it is not necessary for CWDs to also check available electronic sources because the information is already verified by virtue of the clients’ statement.  [Id.]
To request information, counties must use the CW 2200 – Request for Verification form. [See ACIN I-33-21, ACL-20-135, ACIN 1-24-15; ACIN I-01-24 at p.3.] Counties must get written approval from the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) to use a “substitute request for verification” form. A substitute form must contain certain essential information to be valid. [See ACL 14-26.] Adverse actions based on an improper or defective request for verification form may be subject to challenge even beyond the normal 90-day appeal time. Such adverse actions can include denials, terminations or disallowance of deductions.
The County residency requirement
A household must apply for CalFresh benefits in the county in which it lives. [7 C.F.R. § 273.3(a); MPP § 63-401.1.] No person can participate as a member of more than one household, or in more than one county in any month. An exception is made for eligible residents of shelters for battered women and children who were program participants in the home of the abuser. [MPP § 63-401.2, 63-503.46.] The county cannot impose any durational residency requirements. [7 C.F.R. § 273.3(a); MPP § 63-401.4.] The county also cannot require an “intent to reside permanently in the county.” [7 C.F.R. § 273.3(a); MPP § 63-401.5.] Persons in a county solely for vacation purposes should not be considered residents of that county. [MPP § 63-401.5, 401.6.]
No fixed address is necessary. The county cannot require anyone to reside in a permanent dwelling or have a fixed mailing address as a condition of eligibility. [MPP § 63-401.5.] Categorically eligible households do not have to provide verification of residency. (i.e., those already on CalWORKs (TANF) or other public assistance programs)[MPP § 63-301.7.]
Residency can be shown through proof of “rent or mortgage payments, utility expenses, and identity.” If verification cannot be accomplished due to a lack of acceptable evidence, a collateral contact or other readily available documentary evidence should be used. Any documents or collateral contacts which reasonably establish an applicant’s residency must be accepted. The county cannot require a specific type of verification be used. [See 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(1)(vi); MPP § 63-300.5(e)(5).]  Residency must be verified to the extent possible, using all documents already provided by a household.  {ACL 20-135.]
Migrant farm worker households, homeless households, or households newly arrived in the community may not be able to provide satisfactory verification of residency. In these instances, if the applicant with the county’s assistance has (1) made reasonable efforts to obtain verification; and (2) verification cannot be obtained; and (3) the applicant’s statement regarding residency is not questionable, the county must proceed with certification if the household is otherwise eligible. Except for homeless household, verification of residency must be provided by such households prior to their next certification. [See MPP § 63-300.5(e)(5)(A).]
Optional verifications
The CalFresh case worker may also ask the applicant to prove other facts.  Information that is not considered mandatory verification must only be verified is it is questionable.  The county must document in the case record why the information is considered questionable before requesting verification from the household.  [ACL 20-48.] The CalFresh office should not ask the applicant to bring in any specific documentation. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2(f)(4)(i) and 273.2(f)(5).] The CalFresh office’s rules about verification must not have the effect of discriminating against any group of people. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(3)(i).] The CalFresh office should ask the household members to verify their present circumstances. Applicants should not be asked about things in the past that do not affect their current eligibility.
The CalFresh office may ask the household to verify the following:
         * Any dependent care costs the household is claiming. [MPP § 63-300.5(f)(1).] Households may self-certify their dependent care costs, and the county may ask for proof only if the statement is questionable. [ACL 13-102.] (See the section on common verification problems for more details.)
         * Liquid resources and whether monies received by the household are loans. In order to be a loan, a simple statement signed by both parties indicating the payment is a loan and must be repaid is sufficient. [See MPP § 63-300.5(f)(2).]
         * The size of the household. this is verifiable through a collateral contact or documentary evidence such as school records, census records or marriage records. [See MPP § 63-300.5(f)(3).]
For factors other than mandatory verifications, a client statement must be accepted as verification unless the information provided is questionable. [ACL 20-135.]
Exceptions to the CalFresh student eligibility rule only need to be verified when information provided by the household is questionable, or if the student’s mental or physical unfitness is not evident. [ACL 21-58.] Information is considered questionable if it differs from previous statements or other information received by the county, and the inconsistency must be resolved before receiving CalFresh benefits. [Id.] Verification for physical or mental unfitness is required when the unfitness or disability is not evident to the county and can be provided by any medical health professional or the applicant’s case manager. [Id.]
Verification of job loss or zero income
Verification of job loss is not mandatory. When a household member reports to have lost a job, the county must not require verification unless it is questionable.  The client’s statement of recent job loss is sufficient evidence that a household cannot reasonably anticipate income from that job to continue during the certification period. [ACL 20-48.]
If an applicant who is subject to work requirements voluntarily quit their job within 60 days prior to the date of the application, the county must determine whether there was good cause to quit.  The county must request verification if the information provided is questionable. [Id.]
When a household has zero income at initial application, a statement on the application that it has zero income is sufficient evidence that the household cannot reasonably anticipate income during the certification period.  The county must not require verification of zero income unless it is questionable. [Id.]
If an applicant or recipient has applied for Unemployment Insurance but is not yet receiving that benefit, the county must accept a statement under penalty of perjury that the applicant or recipient is not receiving Unemployment Insurance, even if that statement differs from documentary evidence from the Employment Development Department.  [All County Welfare Directors Letter, January 29, 2021.]


How the CalFresh program verifies information
         * Paper documents
         * References (“collateral contacts”)
         * Home visits
         * Computer and electronic data sources
         * Consumer Credit Reports
         * For related information, see the section about common verification problems
Paper documents
Paper verification means documents like pay stubs, utility bills, a driver’s license or an I.D. card for another benefit program. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(4)(i); MPP § 63-300.5(h)(1).] Documents are the counties primary source of verification for everything except residency and household size. Counties cannot limit verification to any specific type of documentation. [MPP § 63-300.5(h)(1).]
Generally, applicants should bring receipts of recent income and expenses. The CDSS provides a list of documents to bring to the interview. If an applicant cannot get all the information together before the interview, they will have additional time to provide the missing information after the interview. If an applicant needs help getting documentation, he should discuss his needs with the CalFresh case worker during the interview.
References (“collateral contacts”)
References (“collateral contacts”) are non-household members the CalFresh office calls directly to confirm information provided by the household. The CalFresh office should only call collateral contacts when documentation is missing or insufficient. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(4)(ii); MPP § 63-300.5(h)(2).]
Applicants should designate appropriate collateral contacts for the county case worker. If an applicant does not designate a acceptable collateral contact, the case worker may select a collateral contact. If the household does not want the CalFresh office to contact the person selected by a case worker, the household should be given an alternative means to verify information, or withdraw its application. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2(c)(6), (f)(5)(ii).]
Collateral contacts may be made either in person or over the telephone. The acceptability of a collateral contact “shall not be restricted to a particular individual but may be anyone that can be expected to provide an accurate third-party verification of the household’s statements.” [MPP § 300.5 (h)(2).]
Acceptable collateral contacts include employers, landlords, social service agencies, migrant service agencies, and neighbors of the household. The CalFresh office can contact these types of individuals to confirm admissions by the household. For example, the CalFresh office might ask an employer to send a letter confirming wages. Or, the CalFresh office might call a landlord or neighbors to confirm an address.
Broadly speaking, disclosures for verification are permitted and do not violate privacy protections. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(b)(4), (f)(4)(ii); MPP § 63-300.5(h)(2).] That said, when contacting references, case workers should avoid disclosing that a household has applied for CalFresh benefits. Case workers should not disclose information supplied by the household. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.1(c), 273.2(f)(4)(i).] Case workers should also not suggest that the household is suspected of any wrong doing.
The county is responsible for obtaining verification from acceptable collateral contacts. [7 C.F.R. 273.2(f)(5)(ii).] The county cannot deem a household ineligible because a person outside of the household fails to cooperate with a request for verification. [7 C.F.R. 273.2(d)1.]
Home visits
The CalFresh office can only use home visits when documentary evidence is insufficient to provide “a firm determination of eligibility or benefit level”. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(4)(iii).] Home visits should be determined on a case-by-case basis, and must be scheduled in advance with the household [MPP § 63-300.5(h)(3)]. A worker does not have to tell applicants the exact time of the visit. Applicants do not have to let workers visit their home, but this could lead to a denial of benefits.
Home visits conducted by the CalFresh office do not violate the Fourth Amendment or the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. [See, e.g., S.L. v. Whitburn, 67 F.3d 1299, 1306-7, 131 (7th Cir. 1995).] When field representatives from the CalFresh office make contact with applicants, they must identify themselves as field representatives, and ask for permission to enter the applicants home.
Counties can require a home visit, including entering the home, as a condition of eligibility for CalFresh.  [Sanchez v. County of San Diego, 464 F.3d 916 (9th Cir. 2006); Smith v. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, 104 Cal.App.4th 1104.]
Computer and electronic data sources
The CalFresh office can also verify applicant information from computer systems. [7 C.F.R. §§ 273.2(f)(9), 272.8; MPP §§ 63-300.5(h)(4), 20-006.]
California’s Income and Eligibility Verification System (IEVS) is the umbrella term used for the many computer matching systems that assist in the eligibility determination for California public benefit programs. California Food Policy Advocates has created a detailed chart summarizing what IEVS matches with what in California.  IEVS information received directly from the income/benefit source such as SSA (called the Payment Verification System) is considered verified upon receipt.  [MPP § 20-006.531.]  
The CalFresh office commonly checks information from government and state agencies as well. Some notable federal agencies include the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Some notable state agencies include the California Employment Development Department (EDD), the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) and the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). These agencies may have the records needed to verify eligibility for CalFresh. The CalFresh office usually will not tell applicants when it is checking information in this way.
The CalFresh office should not immediately act on information it gets from computer records which would result in disqualification or reduction of CalFresh benefits until information is verified. [7 C.F.R. § 272.8(c)(1)(ii), MPP § 20-006.541.]  For IVES information, the county must notify the recipient of the information in writing within 45 days of receiving the data match from CDSS and give 10 days for the recipient to respond.  [MPP § 20-006.543, ACL 17-41.]  A household’s failure or refusal to respond to this notice justifies terminating benefits.  [MPP § 20-006.543(b)(1), ACL 17-41.]
If the household does not respond, the county can use the Work Number or another third party payroll source to verify the IEVS match.  [ACL 24-23.]  Counties can only request verification related to an IEVS discrepancy that shows the client may have missed a mandatory report of income over the Income Reporting Threshold.  [Ibid.]
When reconciling IEVS matches, counties must consider prospective budgeting rules, including whether the income could have been reasonably anticipated at the time of the previous semi-annual report or annual recertification.  [Id.] Counties must either establish an overpayment or overissuance or determine that no discrepancy exists by the end of the quarter following the quarter when the county received the IEVS match.  [ACL 17-41.]
There are special rules for information that is unclear, which is information about a household’s circumstances from which the county cannot readily determine the impact on the household’s continued eligibility or benefit amount.  [7 C.F.R. § 273.12(c)(3); ACL 18-20.]  If the information received during the certification period is considered unclear and is less than 60 days old relative to the first day of the month in which the information was received, and indicates the household missed a required report, the county must issue a request for verification to the household.  [ACL 21-101; ACL 18-20.]  The county must use the CW 2200 form for this request.  [Id.]  The form must inform households that they have 10 days from the date of the form to respond.
If the household responds within 10 days by providing sufficient information, the county must act accordingly to determine continuing eligibility.  If the household does not respond or responds but refuses to provide sufficient information by the specified date, a discontinuance notice is sent to the household.  [Id.]  Note that there must be refusal to provide the requested information to justify termination of benefits.  Failure to provide information is not a basis for adverse action.  Federal regulation defines refusal as “the household must be able to cooperate, but clearly demonstrate that it will not take actions that it can take and that are required.  [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(d), see also MPP § 63-505.12.]
If the information is unclear, is more than 60 days old relative to the first day of the month in which the information was received, and does not indicate the household missed a required report, the county is not required to immediately follow-up on the information and instead will hold the information until the next SAR or recertification.  [ACL 18-20.]
If the county receives unclear information from the Nationwide Prisoner Match or Deceased Persons Match the county must request additional information from the household regardless of the age of the information.  [Id.]  The county must use the CW 2200 form to request additional information.  If the household does not respond or responds but refuses to provide sufficient information, the county shall act on the change by removing the individual from the household and adjusting benefits accordingly.
Counties also use Applicant IEVS at initial application and each subsequent redetermination.  [ACL 19-78.]  Counties must use Applicant IEVS to assist in resolving any potential discrepancies with what was reported on the application (SAWS 2) and/or in the interview.  [Id.]  These discrepancies must be resolved prior to the beginning of a new certification period.  However, the eligibility determination cannot be delayed pending receipt of Applicant IEVS if other information establishes eligibility.  [Id.]
Counties must request Applicant IEVS information at least 15 days prior to the redetermination interview.  If a county cannot resolve a discrepancy relevant to the eligibility determination, the county must provide the client with a CW 2200 verification letter.  [Id.]
Consumer Credit Reports
Counties can also use consumer credit reports to verify information.  For example, CDSS has a contract with “The Work Number” to provide employment verification data.  [ACL 16-43.]  Counties cannot obtain consumer credit reports without written authorization of the applicant or recipient.  Consumer credit reports can be used in conjunction with existing fraud detection resources.  Consumer credit reports cannot be used as the only means of verification.  The SAWS 2 Plus, CF 285 and CF 37 now include authorization for counties to obtain consumer credit reports.
If a county takes adverse action based on information in a consumer credit report, the county must provide an informing notice in addition to the notice of action.  The informing notice must include the name, address and telephone number of the consumer credit reporting agency, a statement that the consumer credit reporting agency did not make the decision, a statement of the right to free disclosure from the consumer credit reporting agency within 60 days and a statement of the right to dispute the accuracy of the information with the consumer credit reporting agency.  [Welf. & Inst. Code § 11023; ACL 16-118]
Information from a consumer credit report must be made available to an applicant or recipient who requests it from the county welfare department or if an applicant requests a fair hearing to regarding the information in the consumer credit report.  [Id.]  Information received from “The Work Number” is not considered verified upon receipt for CalFresh.  [ACL 16-118.]  Counties cannot require applicants or recipients to submit hard-copy documentation that is duplicative of the information obtained from a consumer credit report.  [Id
Common verification problems
         * Difficulties in obtaining verification
         * Verification of questionable information
         * Common questionable information
         * Questions about immigration status
Difficulties in obtaining verification
The household is primarily responsible for providing documentary evidence to support statements made on the application. It is also responsible for resolving any questionable information. The county is responsible for obtaining information from acceptable collateral contacts. The county must inform the applicant that it will help the person get the verification. [MPP §§ 63-300.37; 63-300.5(i)] This includes payment of a fee related to its production. [See MPP § 40-126.33, which applies to county responsibilities to assist with applications, generally.] The county should provide samples of what types of verification are acceptable.  The county is required to use the CW 2200 verification form or a substitute approved by CDSS.  [ACL 14-26.]
The household must be given at least 10 days from the date of the request to provide required verification. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f).]
For applications, California has been granted a waiver by the federal government that allows counties to choose to deny CalFresh applications for failure to submit requested verification within 10 days of the written request even if 30 days have not passed since the application date.  [ACL 19-57.]  The waiver is in effect until April 30, 2024.  [Id.]  42 counties have chosen to implement this waiver.  [Id.]
Counties must meet several conditions to deny an application for failure to submit requested verification within 10 days of the written request even if 30 days have not passed since the application date including the county completed an interview with the applicant, inform applicants of the 10 day standard both verbally and in writing, the county must assist the applicant in obtaining verification, counties must act on verification submitted within 60 days of the application date without a new application and grant benefits from the date verification is submitted, and if verification is submitted within 30 days of the application date, the county must reopen the application and grant benefits from the original application date. [Id.]
In addition, the notice of denial must state the reason for the denial and inform of the right to submit verification within 30 days of the date of application, and if eligible receive benefits from the application date. [Id.]
Households are considered uncooperative with verification only if they refuse to verify. [MPP § 63-505.12.] CalFresh can deny benefits for a failure to cooperate. However, applicants cannot be denied CalFresh benefits just because they are unable to give the CalFresh office the documentation it needs. A household has not refused to cooperate just because it unsuccessfully attempts to cooperate. Households must be advised that they can ask the county for help. Households should alert the county that they need help, to prevent adverse action. Otherwise counties will treat the failure to verify as a refusal to verify.
The obligation to be cooperative only applies to members of the CalFresh household. The county cannot deny benefits because a collateral contact or other third party failed to cooperate. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(d)(1).] However, “excluded” household members, as defined in MPP § 63-402.22, are not considered outside of the household. [MPP § 63-301.311.]
“Excluded” household members are those who reside with the household, but do receive benefits due to reasons explained in MPP § 63-402.22. The excluded member is not used to determine household size, eligibility and benefit level. [MPP § 63-402.22.] An excluded member would also bar a household from being categorically eligible. Generally, excluded member’s income, resources and deductible expenses would apply towards eligibility and benefit level calculations. Excluded members may cause a household to be denied benefits by failing to cooperate. [MPP § 63-505.12.]
Verifying questionable information
The CalFresh office will ask the applicant to verify any information it has doubts about. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(2), (f)(4)(iv); MPP § 63-300.5(g).] The State should establish guidelines for what constitutes questionable information. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(2)(i).] These requests and guidelines must not discriminate based on race, religion, ethnic background, or national origin. [Id.]
Applicants should be ready to verify as many facts about the household as they can. If a CalFresh worker asks for more information, the applicant should ask the worker to write down what information the county needs. The CalFresh office should give households a written list of the things they must do to help with verification. [7 U.S.C. § 2020(e)(3).]
In California, information is questionable if the information on the application is:
         * Inconsistent with statements made by the applicant;
         * Inconsistent with other information in the application or previous applications; or
         * Inconsistent with information received by the county welfare department.
[MPP § 63-300.5(g); ACIN I-01-24 at p.3.]
Reported income may be questionable if it equals zero or if it is less than reported expenses; however, questionable information cannot be the sole reason for a denial of benefits. [Id.] When determining if information is questionable, the county should base the decision on the household’s individual circumstances. [Id.]
Common questionable information
The Calfresh regulations specify how questionable information about household composition, citizenship, work registration and shared expenses are handled.[MPP §§ 63-300.5(g)(1-4).]
Household composition: the eligibility caseworker may verify situations where an individual is claiming to be a separate CalFresh household. [MPP § 63-300.5(g)(1).] For elderly/disabled persons, this type of verification should be conducted in accordance with MPP § 63-300.5(e)(9)(F).
Citizenship: the household will be asked to provide acceptable verification to show U.S. citizenship status. [MPP § 63-300.5(g)(2)(A).] Acceptable verification includes birth certificates, religious records, certificates of citizenship or naturalization provided by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or U.S. passports. [Id.] Participation in CalWORKs will also be considered acceptable verification if verification of citizenship was obtained for that member. [Id.] If the listed forms of verification are unavailable, the county must accept a signed statement from a U.S. citizen declaring, under penalty of perjury, that the member in question is a U.S. citizen. [Id.]
Any household member whose citizenship is in question will be ineligible to participate until proof of U.S. citizenship is obtained. [MPP § 63-300.5(g)(2)(B).]
An ineligible household member’s income and resources are treated as available to the entire household for the purpose of determining eligibility and benefits. [MPP § 63-300.5(g)(2)(B).] See the section about income and deductions of ineligible immigrants for related details.
Work registration: the Calfresh Program requires all non-exempt participants to register for work when applying for benefits. [MPP § 63-407.1.] CalWORKs participants and people receiving unemployment benefits are some of the groups exempt from the work registration requirement. [MPP § 63-407.21(c).] Work registration exemptions may be subject to verification if deemed questionable.
If a work requirement exemption due to CalWORKs is questionable, the county is responsible for verifying participation in the CalWORKs work program. [MPP § 63-300.5(g)(3)(A).] The county is also responsible for verifying questionable information for unemployment benefit recipients and applicants. In addition to verifying receiving or applying for benefits, the county will also verify that the CalFresh participant is registered to work with the Employment Development Department (EDD). [MPP § 63-300.5(g)(3)(B).]
Work registration exemptions also exist for applicants who voluntarily reduce work effort or quit for good cause. (see MPP § 63-408.4 for what constitutes good cause.) For good cause exemptions, the county will request verification when questionable information exists. It is the responsibility of the household to provide good cause verification. [MPP § 63-300.5(g)(3)(C).]
Acceptable sources of verification include, but are not limited to:
         * the previous employer,
         * employee associations,
         * union representative,
         * grievance committees or organizations.
[MPP § 63-300.5(g)(3)(C)(1).]
If it is difficult or impossible to obtain documentary verification in a timely manner, the county should offer assistance to obtain verification. [Id.] Whenever documentary verification is unavailable, the county should use an acceptable collateral contact provided by the household. The county is responsible for obtaining verification from the collateral contact. If neither the household nor the county are able to obtain the requested verification, the household should not be denied access to the program. [MPP § 63-300.5(g)(3)(C)(2).]
Shared expenses: multiple households existing in the same house can share utility expenses. However, if the county finds a household’s statement about sharing such expenses questionable, the deduction based on the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) will not be factored into the benefits calculation until the “sharing relationship” can be verified. [MPP § 63-300.5(g)(4).]
Failure v. Refusal to Cooperate: An individual cannot be denied SNAP benefits because the he failed to cooperate. [See, e.g., Atkinson v. Ledbetter, 360 S.E.2d 66, 67 (Ga. App. 1987).] An individual can be denied benefits if the individual refused to cooperate. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(d)(1); MPP § 63-505.1.] An applicant who relies on what a caseworker said does not constitute someone “refusing” to cooperate. [See, e.g., Chambers v. Commonwealth, Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 466 A.2d 281, 282 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1983).] Lacking information is not refusing to cooperate. [See Atkinson, 360 S.E.2d 66, 67; 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(d)(1).]
The CalFresh office must give at least ten days for an applicant to get requested information. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(h)(1)(i)(C); MPP § 63-301.411(b).] If the applicant does not obtain the requested verification in time, the CalFresh office can take more than 30 days to determine eligibility for benefits. (See the section about the failure of the CalFresh office to act on an application within 30 days for more.)
Households should have the opportunity to explain and fix discrepancies in the application process before eligibility is determined. [7 C.F.R. § 273.2(f)(4)(iv).] It is important that the CalFresh case worker not assume that the individual is dishonest. [See Bacon v. Toia, 648 F.2d 801, 809 (2d Cir. 1981), aff’d, 457 U.S. 132 (1982); Edwards v. California, 314 U.S. 160, 177 (1941) (“poverty and immorality are not synonymous”).]
Questions about immigration status
The CalFresh office does not — and should not — check information about ineligible immigrant household members who are not applying for CalFresh benefits for themselves. The CalFresh office should not ask about the immigration status of people who live with the applicant but who are not applying for CalFresh benefits along with the applicant. There is no requirement to report any person to the USCIS unless the CalFresh agency has made a determination that an individual in a CalFresh benefits household is unlawfully present in the United States [7 C.F.R. § 273.4(b)(2), MPP § 63-405.8], evidence of which would be the issuance by USCIS of a final order of removal (deportation) against that individual.
The threshold in the regulation is not met where, for example, a parent applies for an eligible child and refuses or is unable to document the parent’s own status. The regulations provide that “when a person indicates inability or unwillingness to provide documentation of alien status, that person should be classified as an ineligible alien.” In such cases the state agency will not continue efforts to obtain that documentation. [7 C.F.R. § 273.4(b)(2); MPP § 63-405.8; see Doe v. Miller, 573 F.Supp. 461, 466-67 (N.D. Ill. 1983].
In the commentary when these regulations were promulgated, USDA cautioned state agencies that “a determination that a person is an ineligible alien is not equivalent to a determination that a person is an illegal alien.” (See, 47 Fed. Reg. 17756, Final Rulemaking (April 23, 1982); 7 C.F.R. § 272.11; MPP § 63-300.5(e)(2)(F)).
